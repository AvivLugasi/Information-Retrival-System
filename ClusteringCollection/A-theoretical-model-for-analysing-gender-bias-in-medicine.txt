                   Abstract
                   During the last decades research has reported unmotivated differences in the treatment of women
                   and men in various areas of clinical and academic medicine. There is an ongoing discussion on how
                   to avoid such gender bias. We developed a three-step-theoretical model to understand how
                   gender bias in medicine can occur and be understood. In this paper we present the model and
                   discuss its usefulness in the efforts to avoid gender bias. In the model gender bias is analysed in
                   relation to assumptions concerning difference/sameness and equity/inequity between women and
                   men. Our model illustrates that gender bias in medicine can arise from assuming sameness and/or
                   equity between women and men when there are genuine differences to consider in biology and
                   disease, as well as in life conditions and experiences. However, gender bias can also arise from
                   assuming differences when there are none, when and if dichotomous stereotypes about women
                   and men are understood as valid. This conceptual thinking can be useful for discussing and avoiding
                   gender bias in clinical work, medical education, career opportunities and documents such as
                   research programs and health care policies. Too meet the various forms of gender bias, different
                   facts and measures are needed. Knowledge about biological differences between women and men
                   will not reduce bias caused by gendered stereotypes or by unawareness of health problems and
                   discrimination associated with gender inequity. Such bias reflects unawareness of gendered
                   attitudes and will not change by facts only. We suggest consciousness-rising activities and
                   continuous reflections on gender attitudes among students, teachers, researchers and decision-
                   makers.
