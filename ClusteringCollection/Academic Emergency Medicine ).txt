Abstract

Objectives: Previous studies have found that female patients receive fewer 
invasive tests for cardiovascular
disease than male patients. The authors assessed whether different clinical 
characteristics at emergency
department presentation account for this gender bias.

Methods: Patients with potential acute coronary syndrome (ACS) who presented to 
a university hospital
were prospectively identified. A structured data instrument that included 
demographic information, chest
pain description, history, physical examination, chest radiography, and 
electrocardiogram (ECG) data was
completed. Hospital course was tracked daily. Patients received 30-day 
telephone follow-up. The main out-
come was whether the patients received objective evaluation for coronary artery 
disease after adjustment
for cardiac risk, including race, age, total number of risk factors, 
Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction
(TIMI) score, ECG, and whether the patient sustained an acute myocardial 
infarction on index hospitalization.

Results: There were 3,514 women (58%) and 2,547 men (42%) studied. They had 
similar presenting char-
acteristics: chest pain quality (pressure/tightness: female 60% vs. male 59%, p 
= 0.6), location (substernal:
female 82% vs. male 80%; p = 0.2), radiation (female 27% vs. male 26%; p = 
0.3), and most associated symp-
toms. Men had more cardiac risk factors (mean 1.5 vs 1.4; p < 0.001), more 
abnormal ECGs (59% vs. 48%;
p  < 0.001), and a higher TIMI risk score (p < 0.001). With respect to the main 
outcome, men received more
cardiac catheterizations (12.6% vs. 6.0%; odds ratio [OR], 2.25; 95% confidence 
interval [CI] = 1.88 to 2.70)
and more stress tests (14.7% vs. 12.3%; OR, 1.22; 95% CI = 1.05 to 1.42). After 
adjustment for age, race, car-
diac risk factors, ECG, and TIMI risk score, men still received more cardiac 
catheterizations (adjusted OR,
1.72; 95% CI = 1.40 to 2.11) and stress tests (adjusted OR, 1.16; 95% CI = 1.01 
to 1.33). Models adjusting for
acute myocardial infarction or death, high-risk initial clinical impression, or 
emergency department dispo-
sition found similar results for increased likelihood of cardiac 
catheterization in men but no difference in
stress testing between men and women.

Conclusions: Female patients with potential ACS receive fewer cardiac 
catheterizations than male patients,
even when presenting complaint, history, ECG, and diagnosis are taken into 
account. The gender bias
cannot be explained by differences in presentation or clinical course.

oronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause
of mortality in women and men. In 2003, 53% of
the 900,000 cardiovascular disease–attributable

deaths were in women.¹ However, fewer studies have
examined the diagnosis, management, and treatment of

CAD in women than in men. There has even been debate
that diagnostic testing, such as exercise echocardiogra-
phy, may not have similar sensitivity and specificity in
women as in men.²–⁵ Studies have shown that women pre-
sent differently than men with CAD; women are more
likely to present with stable angina,⁶ more likely to have
diabetes⁷ or hypertension,⁷,⁸ and more likely to have
nonspecific changes on an electrocardiogram (ECG).⁹

The Yentl syndrome was first discussed more than

15 years ago, highlighting the disparity in treatment
between women and men with CAD. Healy suggested
that  to be treated for CAD and receive similar degrees
of treatment, women had to present similarly or more
ill than men.¹⁰ Although some studies have supported

TESTING


this contention,⁶–⁹ others have refuted it.¹¹,¹² Studies
have shown that women with acute coronary syndromes
(ACS) have delayed presentation and treatment, espe-
cially with regard to invasive measures such as diagnos-
tic catheterization, percutaneous coronary intervention,
and coronary artery bypass grafting.¹³–¹⁸ Women are
also less likely to receive noninvasive first-line interven-
tions, such as an ECG, cardiac monitoring, measurement
of oxygen saturation, and aspirin.¹⁹,²⁰

We are unaware of any large study that examines the
relationship between the different presentations of chest
pain between men and women and its impact on evalua-
tion and treatment of ACS. We assessed whether differ-
ent clinical characteristics at emergency department (ED)
presentation can account for the previously documented
gender bias in the evaluation and management of pa-
tients with potential ACS.

METHODS

Study Design

We conducted an observational cohort study of patients
presenting to the ED with chest pain to determine
whether or not there were differences in diagnostic eval-
uation and whether any differences could be explained
by differences in presenting characteristics, cardiac
risk, or hospital course. All study subjects provided in-
formed consent. Data were collected after approval by
the University of Pennsylvania Committee on Research
Involving Human Subjects.

Study Setting and Population

This study was conducted at the Hospital of the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania, a university teaching hospital that
has an annual census of approximately 54,000 adult
patient visits per year.

Patients at least 30 years of age who presented to the
ED with a complaint of chest pain prompting an ECG
were included. The decision to order an ECG was made
by the treating physician. Patients were eligible whether
or not they were admitted to the hospital. Patients were
excluded if they were younger than the stated ages, self
reported cocaine use, did not have chest pain, or did
not have an ECG obtained. We excluded patients with re-
cent cocaine use because they are much more likely to be
male and could bias the results of our study. Broad inclu-
sion criteria were intentionally chosen to ensure data
would be generalizable.

Study Protocol

Study subjects were identified by trained research assis-
tants present in the ED seven days a week from 8 AM to
midnight. Data were collected in accordance with stan-
dardized reporting guidelines.²¹ Patients were treated
by full-time board-certified or board-eligible emergency
physicians in conjunction with housestaff, if present. In-
formation collected included basic demographic infor-
mation, characteristics of chest pain and associated
symptoms, cardiac history and risk factors, medications,
treatment, and disposition.

Admitted patients were followed up daily through their
hospital stay through direct communication between the
investigators and the health care team. All patients had

telephone follow-up after 30 days, regardless of whether
they were initially admitted or discharged. Medical rec-
ords were reviewed when patients or proxies were un-
able to provide follow-up information.

Acute  myocardial  infarction  (AMI)  was  defined  in
accordance with the European Society of Cardiology/
American College of Cardiology guidelines.²²,²³ Diagnos-
tic testing included noninvasive provocative testing (ex-
ercise or pharmacologic stress testing with or without
imaging) or cardiac catheterization. Computed tomo-
graphic coronary angiography was not being performed
during the time frame of this study. An abnormal stress
test included any test with reversible abnormalities by
the interpreting cardiologist or radiologist. An abnormal
cardiac catheterization included patients who had >70%
stenosis of one or more vessels. Mortality data were col-
lected from communication with the treating physician
or family members or from record review.

Measures

ECG Data. The ECGs were interpreted in accordance
with standardized reporting criteria.²¹ The treating phy-
sician categorized the ECG based on the presence or
absence of ST-segment elevation or depression, T-wave
inversions, Q waves, left or right bundle branch blocks,
or nonspecific ECG changes. The physician also noted
if these changes were known to be old, on the basis of
comparison with prior ECGs, when available.

Cardiac Biomarker Assays. Cardiac troponin I and cre-
atinine kinase–myocardial band isoenzyme assays were
performed if requested by the treating physician. During
the  study period, we used an enzyme-linked immunoas-
say using an Abbott AxSYM automated analyzer (Abbott
Laboratories, Mountain View, CA).

Data Analysis

Data were imported into SAS statistical software (ver-
sion 9.1; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) for analysis. Cate-
gorical data are presented as the percent frequency of
occurrence, and continuous data are presented as me-
dians  with interquartile ranges or means with standard
deviations, as appropriate. Comparisons between male
and female patients were performed with t-tests, chi-
square tests, or Fisher’s exact tests, depending on the
variable. Our analysis plan consisted of a comparison of
the likelihood of obtaining diagnostic testing in men
with that of women, controlling for differences in cardiac
risk. Our model included gender, race, age, total number
of cardiac risk factors,²⁴ Thrombolysis in Myocardial In-
farction (TIMI) risk score,²⁵ initial ECG, and whether or
not the patient met cardiac marker criteria for a myocar-
dial infarction. We did not control for a final diagnosis of
ACS during initial hospitalization to avoid incorporation
bias, because patients may have been diagnosed with
ACS based on cardiac catheterization results, following
the standardized reporting guidelines.²¹

If a difference was found, we planned to examine the
percentage of each gender that was found to have posi-
tive test results (cardiac catheterization or stress tests)
to determine whether the difference in testing could be
explained by the difference in actual disease.

RESULTS

We enrolled a total of 6,061 patients: 2,547 men and 3,514
women. The two groups were clinically similar with re-
spect to many presenting characteristics (Table 1); how-
ever, women were more likely to have normal ECGs
and generally had a lower cardiac risk (lower TIMI risk
scores and fewer cardiac risk factors), and men and
women had different racial distributions.

Compared with women, men received more diagnostic
cardiac catheterizations (12.6% vs. 6.0%; odds ratio [OR],
2.25; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.88 to 2.70) and were

more likely to receive noninvasive stress testing (14.7%
vs. 12.3%; OR, 1.22; 95% CI = 1.05 to 1.42) within 30 days.

In multivariate regression analysis (Figure 1), after
adjustment for age, race, total number of cardiac risk

factors, TIMI risk score, initial ECG, and whether or not
the patient met marker criteria for a myocardial infarction,
men were still more likely to receive diagnostic cardiac
catheterization (OR, 1.72; 95% CI = 1.40 to 2.11) and
more   likely to receive noninvasive diagnostic testing
(OR, 1.16; 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.33). Among admitted patients,
men were more likely to receive cardiac catheterization

(OR, 1.68; 95% CI = 1.36 to 2.07), but there was no differ-
ence in stress testing between admitted men and women
(OR, 1.07; 95% CI = 0.92 to 1.24).

Because there was a difference in likelihood of receiv-
ing diagnostic testing, we also adjusted for differences in
30-day death and AMI (Table 2). After adjustment for the
actual outcome (AMI or death) in addition to age, race,
total number of cardiac risk factors, TIMI risk score, ini-
tial ECG, and whether or not the patient met marker cri-
teria for a myocardial infarction, men were still more
likely to receive cardiac catheterization (OR, 1.60; 95%
CI  = 1.29 to 1.98) and stress testing (OR, 1.17; 95% CI =

1.02 to 1.34).

DISCUSSION

Prior investigators have shown that women are less likely
to receive cardiovascular testing and intervention,¹⁸,²⁶–²⁸
despite the fact that more women die of cardiovascular
disease than men.²⁹ Most of these studies have been con-
ducted in the inpatient and outpatient cardiology referral
setting and have examined patients with known
ACS.⁶,¹⁵,³⁰–³² Most of these studies have not adjusted
for differences in presentation characteristics or patient
preferences. We examined whether male and female pa-
tients  had similar presenting characteristics in a broad-
based cohort, all of whom presented with chest pain,
and found that both groups had similar presenting symp-
toms. Although studies of patients with documented
ACS have found that presentation characteristics differ
between men and women,⁹,³³–³⁵ prior studies in broad-
based ED patient populations have found that they pre-
sent similarly.³⁶–³⁸ Although presenting symptoms were
similar between genders in our study, we found that car-
diac risk differed. We found that men had more cardiac
risk factors, had higher TIMI risk scores, and were

more likely to have an abnormal presenting ECG. Men
also had more prior stress tests and cardiac catheteriza-
tions. It might appear reasonable that male patients, at
increased risk, were more likely to be admitted and re-
ceive objective testing for CAD. Physicians working in
our ED were more likely to have a clinical impression
of cardiac disease in male than female patients. More
men were admitted, and of those who were, more re-
ceived diagnostic testing. The increased admission rate
observed in our study is similar to that seen in prior stud-
ies.³⁶–³⁸ In the study by Johnson et al., women were at
lower risk for cardiac disease than men and were less
likely to have had previous MI, cardiac catheterization,
coronary artery bypass grafting, or angioplasty. How-
ever, there was no difference in the prevalence of hyper-
tension, hypercholesterolemia, or family history of

CAD,³⁷ and other studies have reported similar find-
ings.36,38

In both our study and other studies,⁸,³⁰,³⁸ women who
received a cardiac catheterization were less likely than
male counterparts to have CAD. Others have reported
that women are 30%–50% less likely to have CAD,⁹,¹⁰,³¹
which is consistent with our finding that 57% of women
and 73% of men who received cardiac catheterization
were found to have CAD. Anticipating this finding, we
adjusted for cardiac risk to determine if it might account
for the increased likelihood of men receiving more diag-
nostic testing. After controlling for age, cardiac risk fac-
tors, TIMI risk score, and initial ECG, men were still
almost twice as likely to receive cardiac catheterization.
Despite this difference in diagnostic testing, it did not
appear to affect outcomes in our study. Men had a higher
in-hospital and 30-day adverse event rate compared with
women. This supports the possibility that the discor-
dance in diagnostic testing might be accounted for by
proficient clinical judgment; women presenting to an

The primary adjusted analysis includes age, race, total number of cardiac risk 
factors, Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) risk score, initial elec-
trocardiogram, and whether or not the patient met marker criteria for a 
myocardial infarction. ‘‘Adjusted with outcome included’’ includes all of the
above, plus 30-day death or recurrent acute myocardial infarction. ‘‘Initial ED 
impression of cardiac etiology’’ includes only that subset of patients in
the primary adjusted analysis. ‘‘Admitted patients’’ includes only the admitted 
subset of patients in the primary adjusted analysis.


ED are more likely to have a noncardiac etiology. How-
ever, when we adjusted for 30-day AMI and death, men
were still more likely to receive diagnostic interventions.
It appears likely that a real gender bias may explain the
difference in diagnostic testing, although there are sev-
eral other potential explanations that we cannot fully
assess. It is possible that patient preferences might
play  a role if women are less likely to agree to cardiac
catheterization, even if suggested by the physician, or
that differences in insurance status might lead to varying

recommendations for diagnostic testing.²⁰

LIMITATIONS

Our study population represents only patients who pre-
sented to the ED with symptoms of a potential ACS.
This does not mimic the patient population that receives
cardiac catheterization at our institution or has been ex-
tensively studied in the gender bias literature. As a ter-
tiary referral center with an active transport program,
many cardiac catheterizations are performed on patients
transferred from other facilities. These patients were not
included in our study. We also did not examine whether
there was a bias toward men being more likely to receive
a cardiac catheterization as the first test; however, when
we analyzed patients who received only cardiac catheter-
ization, our results were the same. Also, our study sam-
ple  is representative of our urban ED chest pain

population with predominantly Black patients. It may
be difficult to generalize our results to all patient popula-
tions. Our study included only patients presenting with a
chief complaint of chest pain. Data from the National
Registry of Myocardial Infarction 2 have shown that as
many as 33% of patients with acute ischemia have atypi-
cal symptoms.³⁹

Other variables that were not taken into account but
may have affected the frequency of cardiac catheteriza-
tion are insurance status, marital status, hospital occu-
pancy, and, of course, patient preference. It is possible
that patients or physicians may not have opted to un-
dergo cardiac catheterization due to any one of these is-
sues. Future studies should attempt to account for these
issues, in particular patient preference, to determine
whether the gender bias observed in cardiac catheteriza-
tion utilization is the result of patient preference or
physician practices.

CONCLUSIONS

We found that women were less likely to receive both in-
vasive and noninvasive testing following presentation to
the ED with chest pain. This ‘‘bias’’ cannot be explained
by differences in presenting characteristics or cardiac
risk. Future studies should determine if this can be ex-
plained by patient as compared with physician prefer-
ence for diagnostic testing.

White Men Can’t Suture

Tonight I was working in one of Cape Town, South Africa’s primary care trauma 
clinics, which appeared to be
understaffed, underresourced, and certainly overwhelmed with too many patients 
in need. As a fourth-year
medical student, I was excited to have the opportunity to care for patients in 
a medical system different
from the one that I was accustomed to back in America.

Heading into the trauma resuscitation room, I noticed a young black woman, 
appearing to be in her late 20s,
looking at the floor, somber, with blood slowly seeping from a head laceration. 
She wore a brown dress, di-
sheveled; the right sleeve torn off, a button missing in the front. She had an 
abrasion on her left knee. She had
no shoes; her feet were hardened and cracked. The lines on her face, old scars, 
told a story of their own. In a
city that was constantly bombarded with unprovoked and senseless violence, I 
was not surprised to see yet
another victim.

As I approached her, I asked her name. Slowly looking up, her affect clearly 
blunted, she immediately became
apprehensive. Because she didn’t speak English, I summoned a translator, a 
nearby nurse, to help me with the
medical assessment. It was unveiled that this lady had been hit in the head by 
a brick, thrown by her husband
because his dinner was cold when he arrived home in a drunken stupor. This was 
not the first time that some-
thing like this had occurred. Despite the current circumstances, the nurse 
informed me that the patient refused
to have a white doctor help her. The patient was trying desperately to avoid 
eye contact, staring at the walls,
the ceiling, as if there was something to look at, other than me. There was an 
underlying uneasiness and lack of
trust. Unfortunately, I was the only person capable of repairing this difficult 
head wound in the clinic tonight.

So here I was, having traveled halfway around the world to help those who lack 
reliable access to medical care,
and being told that I could not do my job simply because of the color of my 
skin. At first I was enraged. Why
should my ethnicity play any role in treating patients? This would never happen 
in the United States. And I
needed no more powerful reminder that I was not in America anymore. I began to 
wonder whether there
was a better explanation for her refusal. Was there something in her 
background, something in her soul,
that told her not to trust me, a white man? Was it the years of racial 
segregation, which restricted non-white
South Africans from a variety of public services including health care? 
Although apartheid formally ended in
1994, I presume that the resentment from almost 50 years of oppression still 
lingers in the hearts of many of
the non-white population here in South Africa, and these feelings may have been 
playing a major role in why
this young black woman didn’t want me to help her.

With the nurse translating, I started to explain to the patient the 
consequences of not suturing up her lacer-
ation. The patient laughed; pain, cosmetic outcome, infection, possibly 
death.these items were obviously not
important to her. Because my initial approach wasn’t working, I tried to 
connect with her on a more human
