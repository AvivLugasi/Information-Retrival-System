Abstract
Author Manuscript

Purpose—To systematically review experimental evidence for interventions mitigating gender bias
in employment. Unconscious endorsement of gender stereotypes can undermine academic medicine's
commitment to gender equity.
Method—The authors performed electronic and hand searches for randomized controlled studies
since 1973 of interventions that affect gender differences in evaluation of job applicants. Twentyseven studies met all inclusion criteria. Interventions fell into three categories: application
information, applicant features, and rating conditions.

Author Manuscript

Results—The studies identified gender bias as the difference in ratings or perceptions of men and
women with identical qualifications. Studies reaffirmed negative bias against women being evaluated
for positions traditionally or predominantly held by men (male sex-typed jobs). The assessments of
male and female raters rarely differed. Interventions that provided raters with clear evidence of jobrelevant competencies were effective. However, clearly competent women were rated lower than
equivalent men for male sex-typed jobs unless evidence of communal qualities was also provided.
A commitment to the value of credentials before review of applicants and women's presence at above
25% of the applicant pool eliminated bias against women. Two studies found unconscious resistance
to “antibias” training, which could be overcome with distraction or an intervening task. Explicit
employment equity policies and an attractive appearance benefited men more than women, whereas

repeated employment gaps were more detrimental to men. Masculine-scented perfume favored the
hiring of both sexes. Negative bias occurred against women who expressed anger or who were
perceived as self-promoting.
Conclusions—High-level evidence exists for strategies to mitigate gender bias in hiring.
The success of female physicians is recognized and celebrated both in popular television series
such as “ER,” “Providence,” and “Strong Medicine” and by the National Library of
Medicine.1 Despite explicit support for gender equity in academic medicine, however, female
physicians advance more slowly toward seniority than do male physicians, earn less than male
physicians in similar positions, and have not entered the ranks of leadership at rates predicted
by their proportional presence in academic medicine for the past 30 years.2–4

Physicians are committed to evidence-based practice.5 Studies with random assignment of
participants to an intervention or control group, in particular, provide high levels of evidence
in informing physician decision making.5,6 Decades of social cognitive research exists on how
gender stereotypes lead to assumptions—both implicit (unconscious) and explicit (conscious)
— that consistently impede women's advancement in historically male-dominant fields.7,8 The
success of a job applicant in obtaining a position is a major determinant of that person's ability
to advance in any career. To facilitate the adoption of evidence-based employment practices
in academic medicine, we performed a systematic review of studies with randomized controlled
designs that investigated the impact of an intervention on the activation and application of
gender bias in hiring settings.

Method
Study selection

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The studies we selected met the following inclusion criteria: random assignment of participants
to the intervention or control group, assumption by participants of the role of personnel decision
makers evaluating applicants for employment, publication after 1972 (the year that Congress
passed the Title IX Amendment1 to the Civil Rights Act), blinding of participants to the
intervention, the presence of both men and women in the contrived applicant pool and the
participant (rater) groups, and comparison of the impact of an intervention on ratings of male
and female applicants with identical qualifications. We excluded studies that assessed bias only
by reaction time or accuracy in matching gender-linked stereotypic words or pictures, studies
in which the participants were stated to be less than 18 years old, studies with only women in
the applicant pool (e.g., pregnant and nonpregnant participants), and studies that did not
specifically indicate random assignment of the intervention. We also excluded dissertations,
letters, and abstracts. Although searches had no language restriction, all studies identified were
in English. When the presence of an inclusion criterion was in doubt, the authors achieved
resolution through consensus. This effort usually involved distinguishing between an
intervention that had an impact on gender bias and one that simply documented gender bias in
a different hiring setting (e.g., jobs supervising men or women9).

Data sources and search strategy

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The authors electronically searched the following sites from 1973 (when possible) to June
2008: PubMed, PsychINFO, Web of Science (including Social Science Citation Index),
Cochrane Library, CINAHL, ProQuest, ABI/INFORM (U.S. and international articles on
business and management), ERIC, and SocINDEX. Terms entered from the Medical Subject
Headings (MeSH) of the National Library of Medicine were Human, Female, Prejudice, and
Stereotype(s). Other terms entered individually or in combination were Gender, Women, Hire/
hiring, Bias, Sex roles, Sex, Discrimination, and Research. The authors narrowed database
searches using the term Experimental to identify studies with randomized controlled designs.
Professional librarians performed supplemental searches of ProQuest, PubMed, and Women's
Studies International. Additional reference mining included selected author searches, hand
searches of bibliographies of retrieved studies and meta-analyses, and review of files of senior
faculty who study gender and leadership. The search was considered saturated when relevant
articles reappeared in multiple searches. The authors identified and reviewed abstracts from
citations through each of the above searches (N = 1,920) and retrieved and examined articles
that seemed to meet inclusion criteria (Figure 1). Because of the heterogeneity in interventions
and outcomes, the data were not pooled.
Data extraction

Author Manuscript

We three authors independently reviewed in detail 130 studies. One of us (B.L.), a statistician,
evaluated articles for quality and effectiveness of controls, validity checks on interventions,
and appropriateness of statistical tests. We scored articles for quality by using a modified Jadad
numerical system of one to four points (a point was allowed for single blinding).10 Inclusion
required a score of at least 2. After verification of inclusion criteria, we extracted the following
information: author, year, and country in which study was performed; intervention; outcome
variables; study design; demographic information on study participants (i.e., gender and race–
ethnicity); the construct measured; results; and the P values of statistical procedures.
When an article described more than one experiment, we included only those substudies that
met our inclusion criteria. If more than one of the substudies in a given paper met the criteria,
we reviewed each one but still counted the citation as one study. Twenty-seven studies met all
inclusion criteria. See the Appendix (http://links.lww.com/ACADMED/A1).
The Jadad score was 3 for 4 of the studies11–14 and 2 for the other 23 studies.

Results
Overview of selected studies

Participants in 18 of the 27 studies were college students. Other studies used business (MBA)
or graduate students (3 studies and 1 substudy),15–18 managers,12,19,20 adult workers,21,22 and
members of human resource associations.14 Twenty-three studies were conducted in the United
States: 3 at specified universities,11,13,17 7 in identified regions,12,14,19–21,23,24 and 13 at
unspecified locations. Two studies were conducted in the Netherlands25,26 and 2 in
Germany.27,28 Participants in all studies were categorized by gender; 11 had descriptors of age
(means or ranges),13,14,17,19,21,23,27–31 and 2 provided some description of race and

ethnicity.21,23 Whites made up 72% to 90% of participants in these two studies. Studies
established applicant gender visually by photograph19,28,29,32–36 or video,13,21,37 designation
of sex on the application,18,24 in-person interview,27,37 and/or the use of gendered names and
pronouns (modifications of the Goldberg paradigm38).11,12,14–18,22–32,34 Twenty-four
studies11–13,15,16,18–30,32,34–37,39 examined gender bias in decision making with regard to
applicants for “male sex-typed jobs,” the term applied in much of this research to positions
historically or predominantly occupied by men and/or assumed to require stereotypically male
traits. Such positions included mechanical engineer,11,24 assistant vice president for financial
affairs,18 chair of a district's association of physicians,25,26 sales manager for a heavymachinery company,12 high-ranking chief executive officer,21 and police officer.22,39 Twelve
studies12–14,17,21,24,27,30,33,34,36,39 examined outcomes for female sex-typed jobs (e.g.,
nurse,39 dental receptionist,12 and day care worker24) or gender-neutral jobs (e.g., copy
editor,24 assistant trainee,21 and compensation analyst14). One study13 manipulated the sextyping of a neutral job (computer lab manager) by emphasizing the requirement of either
stereotypic male traits (i.e., technically skilled and able to work under pressure) or stereotypic
female traits (i.e., helpfulness and sensitivity to coworkers). Studies confirmed job sex-typing
with pretested scales11,22–24,26–29,35 or previous studies12–17,19–22,25,27,28,30–34,36,37 that used,
for example, job sex-typing inventories.40–44 Twenty-three studies used
ANOVA,11–27,29,30,32–34,36,37 MANOVA,14,16,19,35 or ANCOVA28,36 to compare main
effects of the intervention and other independent variables and to test for interactions with
gender on the dependent variables of interest. These comparisons were followed by individual
comparisons of findings for male and female applicants with previously planned contrasts or
appropriate post hoc tests. The remaining study used the chi-square test.31

Author Manuscript

All but one study24 confirmed that male applicants are evaluated more positively than female
applicants for employment in male sex-typed jobs. See the Appendix (http://links.lww.com/
ACADMED/A1). It was easier for men than for women with identical qualifications to be
recommended for advancement in the job-acquisition process, such as being granted an
interview or being hired. Other than in a few comparisons within six studies,11,22,24,28,33,37
male and female participants did not differ in their ratings. Interventions fell into one of three
categories (List 1): varying the information provided to raters in the written application (12
studies); changing the behavior, scent, or appearance of the applicant (9 studies); or altering
the conditions under which raters assessed applicants (10 studies). Four studies had
interventions in two of the categories.13,28,32,33
Information provided to raters in written applications

Author Manuscript

Six of the 12 studies in this group assessed the impact on bias against female applicants for a
male sex-typed job of providing clear evidence of job-related competence (relevant educational
or work background,16,17,24,33 high scholastic standing,24,33 job-congruent personality
characteristics,30 or designation as a “finalist in the job competition” by “a panel of
experts”29). Such individuating information was effective in reducing24,30,33 or
eliminating16,17,29 hiring bias. Other studies assessed the impact of matching genderstereotypic, gender-counterstereotypic, or gender-neutral traits of applicants with job sextype.12,13,16,30,33,34 For example, Futoran and Wyer34 selected traits shown to be gender-linked
on the Bem Sex Role Inventory40 (i.e., aggressive, competitive, industrious, and outgoing for

males, and appreciative, considerate, gentle, and helpful for females) to describe male, female,
or gender-ambiguous candidates for jobs that normative occupational data studies have shown
to be considered to require stereotypic male or female traits. Both an applicant's gender and
traits influenced job suitability ratings. Heilman16 found that including positive but jobirrelevant information about female applicants (e.g., having a biology/ political science degree
rather than a business/economics degree when applying for a lower management position)
resulted in lower ratings than did the absence of such information. Glick and colleagues12
provided individuating information that established gender-counterstereotypic personality
traits (e.g., men working in retail sales at a jewelry store and women working in grounds
maintenance) but that was job-irrelevant; they found higher employability ratings for both male
and female applicants with stereotypic masculine traits, although the preference of raters for a
match between job sex-type and applicant gender remained. To measure the degree of gender
stereotyping, the participants in the study by Heilman16 assessed applicants by using five
adjectival scales associated with gender-related work attributes (e.g., emotional–rational,
ambitious–unambitious, tough–soft). Providing a high degree of job-relevant information
about a female applicant eliminated the difference in gender stereotyping between male and
female applicants seen with low job-relevant information or no information. Furthermore,
when composites of these adjectival scores were covaried with applicant ratings, the
perceptions of gender-related attributes rather than the applicant's actual gender accounted for
assessments of hireability and of potential for advancement. Rudman and Glick13 found that
highly competent female applicants benefited from applications that included a written “life
philosophy” endorsing communal (stereotypically female) rather than agentic (stereotypically
male) values, particularly when they were applying for female sex-typed jobs.

Two studies examined the impact of including information on parental status in the
application.18,23 Male and female applicants without children received comparable ratings on
all employment-relevant measures. Parenthood resulted in lower ratings for both male and
female applicants, but women whose applications indicated that they had children were more
disadvantaged. Although both female and male parents were rated as less committed and less
dependable than nonparents, only female applicants with children were rated lower on
measures of hiring and promotion.18,23 One study included both marital and parental status
information in the applications.17 Marital status had little effect on applicant ratings, although
married men with children and single women were ranked as the most suitable applicants for
two neutral sex-typed positions. One study examined the impact of applications that contained
discontinuities in employment and found that men were generally judged more harshly than
women in such cases.14

Author Manuscript

One study compared the effect of gender ambiguity in the application.34 When an applicant's
gender was apparent from the application, women were disadvantaged; however, when
applicants had gender-ambiguous names (e.g., Pat or Chris), job suitability was based solely
on the applicants’ qualifications (even if the inferred gender was female).
Applicant behavior, scent, or appearance
Three studies assessed the impact of interview behavior on gender bias.13,21,37 All found
negative reactions to women who exhibited stereotypic male behaviors. Rudman37 found that,

when applicants of either gender violated behavioral norms— men by being self-effacing and
women by being self-promoting—both were rated lower than applicants who behaved in a
more gender-congruent manner. In one of the few differences by participant gender, female
raters judged self-promoting women more harshly than did male raters. Rudman and Glick13
found that women who exhibited an agentic interview style were rated lower on social skills
than were men, although this difference was eliminated when women's applications included
a communal life philosophy statement. Brescoll and Uhlmann21 found that the expression of
anger by an applicant enhanced the evaluation of men and lowered the evaluation of women,
particularly women applying for a high-status position. The existence of a specific external
cause for anger mitigated but did not eliminate the negative bias toward women; external
attribution for anger improved the status and salary ratings for women who expressed anger
but had no impact on the lower rating of competence.

Author Manuscript

Sczesny and Stahlberg27 and Sczesny and Kühnen28 found that visual and olfactory cues can
activate gender stereotypes independent of the actual biological sex of the applicant. Male and
female applicants wearing a masculine-scented perfume or submitting paper applications to
which such a scent was applied received more positive ratings than did identically qualified
applicants who used a feminine scent.27 This group also found that both men and women who
looked more stereotypically masculine in photographs were favored for hiring into a leadership
position.28

Author Manuscript

Five studies examined the impact of physical attractiveness and found that overall
attractiveness is advantageous, but more so for men than women.19,28,32,33,36 Highly attractive
women can be disadvantaged in applying for male sex-typed jobs, and less attractive women
can be disadvantaged in applying for female sex-typed and neutral jobs. Heilman and
Saruwatari36 found that attractiveness predicted ratings of stereotypic male or female traits
among applicants and that, when these ratings were factored out, the impact of attractiveness
was eliminated.
Conditions under which raters assessed applicants

Author Manuscript

Five studies sought to manipulate automatic gender bias in hiring by informing raters of
employment equity directives11,20,39 or by prior training of raters with an exercise to decrease
the response time to gender-counterstereotypic word associations.25,26 In response to
employment equity directives, Ng and Wiesner39 found that men who were less qualified than
women for a female sex-typed job (i.e., nurse) were more likely to be hired, but this positive
bias for the underrepresented candidate did not hold true for women who were less qualified
than male applicants for a male sex-typed job (i.e., police officer). In the study by Biernat and
Fuegen,11 raters with the expectancy of accountability for their hiring decisions were less likely
to hire a female applicant. Rosen and Mericle20 found that, even under strong employment
equity directives, female applicants were recommended for lower salaries than were men with
identical qualifications. Kawakami and colleagues25,26 engaged raters in “antibias” training
that successfully reduced response time in matching gender-counterstereotypic words that were
displayed sequentially on a computer screen. However, this training did not reduce gender bias
in a subsequent mock-hiring situation unless an intervening task or concurrent cognitive
distraction prevented subjects from correcting against the perceived coercion of training.25 If

participants were able to correct for perceived coercion on an initial task, the preference for
male over female job candidates and the attribution of gender-stereotypic traits were
eliminated.26
Two studies varied the order in which aspects of the hiring process occurred.22,32 Uhlmann
and Cohen22 found that requiring raters to commit to the value of credentials before reviewing
any applicants eliminated gender bias in hiring a police chief. Cann et al32 found better
correlation between applicant ratings and recommendations to hire when raters were forced to
rate applicants’ qualifications separately before, rather than after, providing summary
employability judgments.

Author Manuscript

Heilman15 found that, when women composed 25% or less (i.e., no more than two) of the
applicants in a pool of eight, they were viewed as less qualified than male applicants for a
managerial job and as being more stereotypically female on gender-related adjectival scales
than when women made up at least 37.5% of the pool (three of eight applicants). Covariance
analysis of gender-stereotypic and hireability ratings indicated that the impact of gender
proportion in the applicant pool could be completely accounted for by the stronger attribution
of female gender stereotypes to women when they made up 25% or less of the pool. In a study
by Heilman and Martell,35 priming raters with data that women are succeeding in a relevant
male-dominated field eliminated bias against female applicants, although priming with
information about a single successful woman did not.
Sczesny and Kühnen28 found that rating applicants in the presence of a competing cognitive
demand (i.e., memorizing a nine-digit number) enhanced the evaluation of male applicants for
leadership competence and certainty of hiring. This effect was most pronounced in female
raters.

Discussion
This systematic review reaffirmed the ubiquity of unconscious stereotypes regarding the
behaviors and traits associated with being male or female, the ease with which these stereotypes
are activated, and the consequent negative bias against women applicants for jobs historically
occupied by men. More important, however, this review documents the capability for
mitigating the automatic activation and subsequent application of these biases.

Author Manuscript

Taken together, these studies indicate that, when ambiguity exists in an individual's
qualifications or competence, evaluators will fill the void with assumptions drawn from
gendered stereotypes. Providing individuating proof of competence and past performance
excellence that are relevant to the employment opportunity seems to be effective in mitigating
gender bias,16,17,24,29,30,33 provided that raters do not feel coerced,25,26 conditions enable
raters to fully attend to the information provided,28 and raters commit to the value of specific
credentials both before the review22 and before giving an overall rating.32 Informing raters
about research confirming women's competence in sex-typed male tasks is also effective.35
Given the large number of competent women physicians and scientists, this approach would
seem to be a fairly straightforward way to ensure gender equity. The studies reviewed also
indicate, however, that the issue is more complex than expected. Women who are clearly

competent in male sex-typed roles may engender negative reactions37 and lower ratings simply
because their competence violates the prescriptive norms for female behavior.31 This outcome
seems particularly likely for women who exhibit anger (a “male” emotion45) and for women
who use self-promoting, powerful verbal and nonverbal status cues.37 At the same time, men
are penalized in evaluations for exhibiting communal or stereotypic female behaviors (e.g.,
parenthood or self-effacing speech).23,37 Providing evidence that agentic, competent women
also behave in gender-congruent communal ways helps mitigate this negative bias13,31,37;
however, women must be careful not to seem overly communal by bringing attention to the
fact that they are parents or by seeming too feminine in appearance or scent.18,23,27,28 The
potential benefit to a woman who is applying for a male sex-typed job of having a genderambiguous name34 is worth noting.

Author Manuscript

Diversity training and employment equity policies would seem logical institutional initiatives
to promote gender equity. Evidence from our review suggests, however, that these directives
do not ensure gender equity in hiring.20,39 Furthermore, if such directives result in women's
presence as a small proportion of an applicant pool, individuating from the stereotypes of the
social group that women occupy becomes more difficult, and they may be less likely to be
hired.15 Counterstereotype training was effective only under certain circumstances.25,26

This review covered more than 30 years of publications. More recent studies often built on
previous work and tended to employ more sophisticated interventions and analyses, but there
was no clear diminution of gender bias in the findings between earlier and more recent studies.
Several studies did not meet all inclusion criteria but are worth mentioning. Bragger and
colleagues46 found that structured interviews with standardized, sequential questions that were
relevant to the position eliminated the hiring bias against pregnant applicants found when the
same information was obtained through haphazard conversation. Glick and colleagues47 found
“sexy” attire was a particular disadvantage, as compared with neutral dress, for women
applying for a managerial position. Wiley and Eskilson48 found that applicants with tentative
speech patterns, regardless of gender, received lower ratings. The benefit of gender ambiguity
was striking in a study comparing employer response to identical resumes with female names
or initials.49 Davies and colleagues50 found that affirmation that both men and women are
equally capable prevented female-stereotype priming from undermining women's subsequent
leadership aspirations. McConnell and Fazio51 found that use of the title “chairman” primed
raters to give a position more stereotypic masculine ratings than did the use of “chairperson”
or “chair.” Martell52 found that gender bias in rating police officers was eliminated by the
reducing time pressure and cognitive distraction during evaluation. Heilman and Okimoto31
confirmed the importance for highly agentic women of providing evidence of communality,
to prevent negative ratings. Hugenberg and colleagues53 found less gender bias in selection
when raters decided whom to include rather than whom to exclude from a list of individuals
in a male sex-typed job.
This study had some limitations. Evidence-based recommendations are limited by the
predominant use of college students as participants,54–56 although gender bias in evaluation
was also found in the six studies with adult nonstudent participants.12,14,19–22 Furthermore,
Marlowe and colleagues19 found gender biases even in the evaluations of experienced
managers. The absence of any study in an academic medicine setting is a limitation in the

capacity to generalize our findings to academic medicine. We also have little information on
the ethnic–racial diversity of the participants, but, given the populations from which these
studies drew participants, it is likely that nearly all were white. Finally, although the
randomized controlled design of these studies is important for establishing a causal relationship
between the intervention and the outcome, the success of these interventions in actual
employment settings is unknown.

Conclusions

Author Manuscript

This review identifies several institutional interventions with a high level of evidence
promising the possibility of promoting gender equity in hiring (List 2). The limitations of the
studies, in combination with the continual and rapid evolution of social norms, make us
reluctant to dictate to individual female applicants behaviors that may enhance their hireability.
Whereas we are mindful of these caveats, we also provide recommendations for individual
applicants that are supported by the existing research evidence (List 2).
The National Institutes of Health Roadmap calls for scientists to move beyond the limits of
their own discipline and explore new organizational models for interdisciplinary science.57
Evidence-based practice has become a core value of academic medicine.5 With this systematic
review, we encourage those within the institution of academic medicine to apply evidence from
social science research to the practice of personnel decision making.

Evidence-based recommendations to reduce the application of bias that could disadvantage women applicants
in hiring settings*
Recommendations for Institutions
• Design process to allow applicants to provide individuating evidence of job-relevant competency16,17,24,30,33
†

• Visibly display research evidence that men and women are equivalently successful in male sex-typed roles35,50
• Work hard to ensure that women comprise at least 25% of an applicant pool15
• Insist that raters commit to the value of specific credentials before seeing actual applicants22
• Rate specific qualifications before making summary judgments about applicant32
• Design equity directives and antibias training so that raters do not feel coerced during evaluation11,20,25,26,39
• Do not ask about parenthood status in the application18,23
‡,58§

• Encourage raters to spend adequate time and avoid cognitive distractions during evaluation28,52

¶

• Use structured rather than unstructured Interviews46

‡

• Do not use man-suffix in job titles (e.g., use “chair” or “chairperson” as opposed to “chairman”)51

• Implement training workshops for personnel decision makers that include examples of common hiring biases and group problem solving for
§,60††

overcoming such biases59

‡

• Encourage raters to use an inclusion rather than an exclusion selection strategy in constructing a final list of applicants53
Recommendations for female applicants

• Provide some evidence of communal job-relevant behaviors (e.g., being helpful and sensitive to the needs of subordinates)13,18
• Indicate clear evidence of competency (e.g., resume, third-party endorsements) but avoid appearing self-promoting in an
interview12,16,29,30,37
• Do not show anger or discuss previous job-related situations that made you angry21
• Best to avoid feminine-scented perfume, but wearing masculine-scented perfume may be beneficial (although you would need to pretest the
scent to ensure that it is considered “masculine”)27

Author Manuscript

• Avoid revealing parenthood status until job and salary are secured18,23
• In your initial application, if you have a female-gendered first name, consider using initials only, and if you have a gender-ambiguous name,
¶
consider removing gender-identifying information34,49
• Strive for an “attractive” but neutral appearance for interviews or application photographs. Avoid interviewing in overly feminine clothing
¶,61¶,62††

(more masculine clothing and facial features may be beneficial)28,32,36,47

¶

• If you are visibly pregnant, it might be wise to obscure it with your clothing42

• Avoid tentative speech patterns (e.g., use of intensifiers such as “really” and “definitely,” hedges such as “I guess” or “sort of,” and hesitations
††

such as “well” or “let's see”)37,48
*

All studies cited in this table, except those with superscript symbols, met inclusion criteria for the systematic review. The studies with superscripts
are all experimental, controlled studies, but they were excluded from the systematic review for the reasons listed below. We include the citations in
this table because the studies support the recommendation.
