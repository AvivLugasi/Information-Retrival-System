Abstract
Gender bias is unfortunately still present in many societies especially the developing countries. Such prejudice is in
most cases in favor of males and against females. While females nowadays comprise a great majority of the work
force all around the world, they are still being looked upon as the weaker sex associated with stereotypical roles as
stay-at-home mothers whose main task is to breed children, wash the dishes, etc.
Such prejudice if present in a society gets manifested in its EFL/ ESL materials. The main purpose of the present
study is to examine the extent and types of gender bias in two of the Iranian mostly used EFL textbooks at the high
school level. Sexism will be investigated in five categories of visibility, firstness, generic masculine constructions,
sex-linked occupations and activities. The findings are expected to raise awareness regarding sexist practices in EFL
material developers, teachers and learners.
Keywords: Gender bias, Visibility (omission), Firstness, Generic masculine generics
1. Introduction
The present study has been a by-product of another research currently being carried out by the same researchers,
namely Differential Item Functioning (DIF) Analysis of the Iranian Entrance University Examinations. When
important decisions are made based on test scores, it is critical to avoid bias, which may unfairly influence
examinees’ scores. Bias in a test is the presence of some characteristic of an item that results in differential
performance for individuals of the same ability but from different ethnic, age, sex, academic, cultural or religious
groups. Bias is often attributed to construct-irrelevant dimensions that differentially affect the test scores of different
groups of examinees. Sadly so far, the analyses of the results in the study just referred to have revealed considerable
DIF across different examinee groups.
As far as gender bias is concerned, which is the main focus of the present paper at the same time, the Iranian
entrance university examinations is highly and unfairly biased against women and the main reason for that is
undoubtedly the existence of gender-biased high school EFL materials. So the present paper is intended to call the
attention of material developers and decision makers in Iran to take action against gender bias in high school EFL
materials. Since users of any test, including entrance university examinations, must be confident that scores of all
student subgroups can be interpreted in a similar way. The main concern here is perhaps the substantial difference in
the mean test scores of different subgroups. Users of the instrument might worry whether such differences are
caused by the differences in the skills measured or are an artifact of the instrumentation procedure. In other words,
the question here is whether the test measures for various subgroups what it claims to measure!
Studies similar in tone to the present one are not new in our country and already date back to almost two decades
ago. However they might not have been forceful enough to be noticed and attended to by the authorities. The
researchers here would like to ask their colleagues to take part in a serious campaign against gender bias in the
Iranian high school EFL materials and replicate similar studies in different voices hoping the echo would get strong
enough to be noticed by the decision makers.
Language is not only a means of communication but also a reflection of the political, social and cultural attitudes.
Certain language can help reinforce the idea of male superiority and female inferiority. What is now termed sexist

language often suggests an inherent male dominance and superiority in many fields of life. Sexist language is
language that expresses bias in favor of one sex and thus treats the other sex in a discriminatory manner. The word
sexism was originally coined to refer to ideas and practices that downgrade women relative to men (Cameron 1985).
Nowadays, though, it is used to refer to practices that unfairly treat either sex.
One of the flourishing areas of sociolinguistics in the last decades has been that of language and gender motivated
by feminist movements arguing over how language is used as an instrument to discriminate and dominate females
(Key 1975; Lackoff 1975). Drawing from linguistic researches on gender representation in the English Language, a
large number of studies have been directed towards the investigation of gender bias in language teaching materials,
especially in EFL textbooks.
In the EFL context, within the classroom environment it is important that teachers pay attention to gendered
language since language is not value-free, lifeless, or free of political bias (Beebe 1996 in Cook, 2005). The attitudes
repeatedly expressed in books and other media might gradually distort learners’ perceptions regarding stereotypes
and myth about either sex. Students learning a foreign language might internalize sexist male and female
representations reflected in their textbooks. It is thus possible that exposure to gender-biased texts and materials may
influence females’ behavior in such a way as to restrict their social, behavioral, and linguistic roles.
The present paper studies gender bias in two of the widely used Iranian EFL textbooks at the high school level
compiled by the Textbook Curriculum Development and Planning Department of the Ministry of Education of the
Islamic Republic of Iran. The premise of this investigation is that understanding sexism at the school level is an
important, necessary, and often neglected aspect of curricular reform efforts and that such awareness would render
more gender unbiased and valid tests. The focus of this study will be the investigation of gender bias in five
categories of visual and textual presentation of males and females (visibility/ omission), firstness, masculine generic
constructions, occupations, and activities performed by either sex.
2. Previous Studies
Since 1970s, researchers worldwide have shown interest in the study of gender bias in ESL/ EFL materials. Graham
(1975) was among the first to investigate sexism in a school children’s dictionary. She found that the nouns used to
describe male activities were seven times as many as the nouns used for female activities. In addition, the visibility
of males to females was four to one.
In Nilsen’s (1977) analyses of a standard dictionary, it was revealed that the visibility of men to women was three to
one and that there were five times as many words for things named after males than after females. And the words
referring to females were mainly passive compared against the active words used to refer to males.
Coles (1977) studied five series of educational materials in which as the results firmly indicated males outnumbered
females. Furthermore, females were mainly depicted as stay-at-home housewives and mothers whereas males
appeared in a variety of activities and jobs ranging from drivers to doctors.
Hoomes (1978) studied twenty eight high school anthologies. The results indicated that the visibility of females to
males was one to three and that men outnumbered women by far in activities and occupations.
Gerrity (1978) examined a series of primary reading passages in which the stories were absolutely male-oriented and
male-referenced.
Hartman and Judd (1978) explored sexism in ESL materials in their Sexism and TESOL Materials. In their review of
several then popular ESL textbooks, they investigated the treatment of males and females in five categories of
visibility, firstness, occupational roles, nouns used to refer to either sex and masculine generic constructions. In all
the categories studied, both in texts and illustrations women suffered from under-representation with only one
exception concerning ‘firstness’ where the female counterpart was ordered first (ladies and gentlemen).
Hellinger (1980) examined random extracts from three English textbooks. Males once more outnumbered females in
visibility and initiation.
Porreca (1984) studied sexism in some of the then current ESL textbooks in six categories of occurrence (both visual
and textual), occupational roles, nouns, firstness, masculine generic constructions, and adjectives associated to either
sex. In every category of the study, there was evidence that five years after Hartman and Judd’s study, sexism
continued to flourish in ESL materials. Although females comprised slightly over half the population of the United
States, they were depicted or mentioned only half as often as males in both texts and illustrations (Porreca 1984:
718).
Poulou (1997) ran a thorough quantitative and qualitative examination of a number of dialogues. Based on her
findings, whereas male dominance was still prevalent, females were dominant only quantitatively as far as visibility

was concerned.
Johansson and Bachelder (2005) studied four EFL series in terms of four typologies including dialogue initiation,
turn taking, number of characters, and number of words used. In the first series Time (1996-98), men were
overrepresented in three out of the four typologies studied. In the second series Wings (2001-03), men
overrepresented women in two out of the four typologies. In the next two series Happy (2004-06) and What’s up
(2004-07), women overrepresented men in three out of four and all typologies respectively.
Ansary and Babaii (2005) performed two types of analyses to examine the manifestation(s) of sexist attitudes and
values in two textbooks (Right Path to English I & II). In their quantitative analysis, they investigated sex visibility
in both texts and illustrations and female/male topic presentation in dialogs and reading passages. And in their
qualitative analysis, they studied sex-linked job possibilities, sex-based activity types, stereotyped sex, firstness and
masculine generic conception. Results revealed that the books studied were biased in terms of all the categories
investigated.
Lee and Collins (2006) studied gender representation of English textbooks in Hong Kong. Of the twenty recent and
earlier books studied, only 6 were reported in their study since their investigations were still on the way. The
examined sexism in seven categories including omission (visibility), roles, masculine generic constructions, titles,
order of appearance, pictorial representation of both genders and their roles and activities. The comparison of sexism
in recent and earlier textbooks indicated that textbook writers had become more conscious regarding sexist practices
in some categories. Their study however differed from other studies since they included the investigation of
semantic as well as domestic and social roles in their study. Based on the Systemic-Functional concept of transitivity
and its primary semantic categories of participant and process (Lock 1996; Halliday 2004), they investigated gender
bias across five semantic processes (material, verbal, relational, mental and existential) and five categories of
participants. Close examination of various semantic roles revealed subtle gender stereotyping and semantic role
shifts in recent versus earlier textbooks (Lee and Collins 2006).
Mineshima (2008) studied gender representations in an EFL textbook Birdland Oral Communication I to investigate
how it portrays the two genders. She examined sexism in three categories including number of females versus males,
number of their utterances and firstness. In all categories studied, females were under-represented and overloaded
with traditional stereotypical roles whereas males appeared only as cooperative.
Mukundan and Nimehchisalem (2008) studied the representation of gender in some English language textbooks in
Malaysia. The results indicated significant gender bias against both sexes with males outnumbering females in texts
and illustrations and males mainly associated with negative traits. However, discourse wise, males dominated
females. They spoke more, talked first, and were more visible.
Vogli (2009) investigated gender representation in New Success at First Certificate in six categories of omission,
occupation, F/M stereotypes, masculine generic constructions, firstness and adjectives associated to each sex.
Despite the efforts the writers had made to portray women and men equally, the findings indicated that men were
upfront and women followers. Sometimes they (females) were protagonists in a ‘man’s world’ [but that looked like
sugar coat] (Vogli 2009).
3. Method
3.1 Instruments
The instruments used in this study consisted of the 2010-11 Iranian English textbooks for the second and third
grades of high school compiled by the Textbook Curriculum Development and Planning Department of the Ministry
of Education of the Islamic Republic of Iran.
Book II consisted of seven lessons and Book III of six lessons, each beginning with a new words section,
accompanied by a reading passage. After the reading text, comprehension questions followed in forms of True/False,
Complete the sentences, etc. Then, there came the speaking and writing sections in different exercise patterns. Other
sections which could be noticed were language functions, pronunciation practice, vocabulary review or drill and a
vocabulary list.
Both at the beginning and the end of each book, there were some review exercises which were excluded from the
gender bias analyses in the present study because they were intended to check the mastery of the students over the
EFL materials covered so far since the beginning of the Iranian EFL instruction (junior high school).
3.2 Design
The present study is mainly a descriptive research including quantitative and qualitative investigations of the
visibility (frequency and nature) of the two genders across five categories including omission, firstness, masculine

generic constructions, occupations and activities in two of the Iranian EFL textbooks currently practiced at the high
school level.
3.3 Procedure
In the present textbook gender bias research, sexism has been studied across five categories including visibility,
firstness, masculine generic constructions, occupations and activities associated with either sex in the following
order.
First, the visibility of females and males in both texts and illustrations was investigated. Female/male firstness -- the
number of times when males or females were presented first in texts – was also recorded. To witness whether
masculine generic constructions were truly generic (including both sexes) or merely male referenced, the association
between all masculine generic nouns and pronouns and their referents was determined as well.
In addition, occupations in which females and males were depicted were identified and compared against. Finally,
the type of illustrated and textual activities in which females and males participated was investigated.
4. Findings
4.1 Visibility
One of the main manifestations of sexism in textbooks has always been female/ male visibility also called omission.
When females do not appear as often as males, the implicit message is that women are not as important as men, or
that their accomplishments are not as worthwhile to mention as men’s or that they themselves as human beings are
not important enough to be included (Porreca 1984:706).
In Iran, according to census statistics, the number of females in recent years has consistently surpassed that of males.
And for the textbooks here investigated to be authentic and sex fair, they should reflect such demographic pattern.
To see whether this is reflected in the Iranian EFL textbooks or not, the number of textual and visual mentions of
male and female characters was counted both in the second and third grade EFL Iranian textbooks at the high school
level. Tables 1 and 2 below illustrate the findings.
As indicated in Table 1, it was found that there were 52 male (80%) and 13 female (20%) characters in Book II
illustrations, and 76 female (18.8) and 329 male (81.2) characters in Book II texts. Things were not any better in
Book III.
In Book III illustrations, out of 59 depictions, 37 (62.7) belonged to males and only 22 (37.3) to females. And in
texts, the condition even got worse. Out of 229 mentions, only 38 (16.6) concerned females.
Both tables as presented here reinforce the assumption that women are underrepresented in terms of visibility in
number in Iranian high school EFL textbooks in a way that does by no way reflect the reality.
4.2 Firstness
Firstness refers to the mention of men first in texts before women as if ‘the masculine gender is more worthy than
the feminine’ (Poole 1946:21; cited in Eckert and McConnell-Ginet 2003:34).
In Iran, men in most cases come ahead of women in most social practices. When walking together for instance,
women usually follow their men. In parties and public ceremonies, men are served first. In Iran, it is almost
‘Gentlemen first, ladies next!’
To investigate gender firstness in Iranian high school textbooks, the present study examined all the instances in the
two textbooks in which the two genders were mentioned together and checked which appeared first. Here are the
findings.
In Book II, for 12 (85.71%) first mentions of males, there were only 2 (14.28) first mentions of females.
In Book III, there was one out of one instance of male firstness. As indicated in Tables 3 and 4, men in majority of
the cases are mentioned first. Such subordination of females as mentioned earlier is deeply rooted in the Iranian
culture.
4.3 Masculine Generic Constructions
One other manifestation of sexism is the use of the masculine as generic rooted in the grammar of the English
language itself. In most cases where words like man, person, etc. and pronouns such as everybody, somebody, etc.
are used in EFL textbooks, people hardly ever conceptualize females when reading such constructions (Porreca
1984). Quite recently, however, masculine generics are being avoided in EFL/ ESL textbooks. One strategy is to use
paired pronoun expressions such as he/she, him/her, his/her, and s/he.
To investigate this issue, all occurrences of generic constructions were identified and analyzed to see whether

masculine generic constructions were truly generics (including both females and males) or exclusively male
referenced.
In Book II (page 87), there was only one case of a masculine generic construction that was definitely male
referenced as presented below:
If someone asks you “where are you going?”, you, ………….. .
a. should give a true answer
b. should tell him where you are actually going
c. don’t have to tell him where you are going
d. can give a quick reply
And in Book III, there were four instances of masculine generic constructions which were all male-referenced:


This education should prepare the person for the job he can do best. (p. 24)


When a person heard a voice speaking over the telephone from miles away, he was too exited to say
‘How do you do?’ or ‘Good morning’. (p. 67)


And when someone fasts, it means he doesn’t eat. (p. 68)



A pilot must do his work with great ….. . (p. 93)

4.4 Occupation
The depiction of males and females in traditionally stereotypical biased occupations can be another reflection of
sexism in EFL textbooks. Table 5 below lists various occupations female and male characters were engaged in as far
as texts and pictures were concerned in book II.
Of the 19 (not considering the number of times an occupation was repeated) occupations either mentioned in texts or
illustrated in pictures in Book II, 17 different jobs such as engineers, bus drivers, police officers, doctors and bosses
belonged to men and in only 2 women were stereotypically depicted (either as teachers or dress makers).
And in Book III, the ratio of appearance of females to males in both texts and illustrations (ignoring repetitions of
the same occupation) was 3 to 13. Here again, men were depicted in a variety of manly jobs including wrestlers,
pilots, hunters, etc. And women played their ever traditional roles as nurses, teachers, and only once as doctors.
For the word, inventor, there was only one male mention displaying men as ever achievers.
4.5 Activities
Both men and women should be shown cleaning, cooking, making household repairs, doing laundry, washing the car,
and taking care of the children … Males as well as females can be fearful, weak, mechanically inept, and
illogical … Males can be polite, cooperative, inactive, or neat. Because such characteristics are shared by males and
females in reality, textbooks that classify them as ‘masculine’ or ‘feminine’ are misrepresenting reality (Scott
1981:139 in Mineshima 2008).
Contrary to the above generous quote, in Iran, men work out and women usually stay in, taking hold of the house
choirs; taking care of the children, cooking meals, cleaning the house, washing the dishes, etc. The Iranian woman
whether working out or staying at home is solely in charge of the household and his man if kind enough may
cooperate sometimes.
To examine the presentation of females and males in Books II and III texts and illustrations, the activities in which
females and males were depicted were located and studied. Tables 7 and 8 below display the findings.
As can be seen in Table 7, texts and pictures in Book II did reinforce traditionally gendered roles: there were only
females engaged in various kinds of household chores. More importantly, of the 40 (not considering the number of
repetitions) different activities illustrated in Book II, women were represented in only 13 including cooking the
dinner, making the tea, etc.
In Book III as presented below in Table 8, the picture was not much different.
5. Discussion and Conclusions
The present study was an attempt to re-examine the second and third Iranian EFL textbooks at the high school level
to investigate how they portray the two genders both in texts and illustrations after almost two decades of attention
to the avoidance of gender biased materials. In every category there was evidence that sexism is still vividly
practiced in Iranian EFL materials.

Although females comprise over half the population of the Islamic Republic of Iran and are recently quite active in a
variety of social roles, they suffered from low visibility both in texts and illustrations. It seems that the Islamic
Iranian culture tends to leave no room for female visibility. A woman would better be invisible from the public eye
as much as possible. Within the family, in many cases she is not welcome in men gatherings. Out, she still gets
called using her eldest son’s name (by her husband) rather than her own to avoid visibility. Upon her death, on her
funeral notice her photo usually gets replaced with a flower.
Since textbooks reflect the social, cultural and religious ideologies and perceptions of their writers, it is no doubt
there is not much room for women visibility in the Iranian EFL textbooks at the high school level.
Regarding firstness, again in majority of cases men were mentioned before women as is the case in the present
Iranian culture especially in traditional families. In the two books studied here the masculine generic was in addition
solely male referenced. Considering occupation, gender inequality was perceived even more. In the Islamic
Republic of Iran today, women comprise a high percentage of the work force, and a great number of women are
involved in highly skilled, professional jobs. However, in two Iranian high school textbooks investigated, this was
not realistically depicted. Women were mainly illustrated in traditional sex-linked occupations such as teaching and
doing household chores. This is far from the reality and equity. Currently women are proving more capable of the
traditionally marked occupations, they are even seen as bus drivers in bigger cities where globalization is on the
way!
Regarding the depiction of males/ females in activities, women were overall stereotyped as stay-at-home mothers
and mainly engaged in household choirs including room cleaning, making the tea, and baking the cake and only
sometimes had the chance of studying or watching TV. They were usually depicted as over-emotional and careless
creatures that cried after TV films (Book II, p. 44) and more often than not lost things and only then busied
themselves finding them (Book II, pp. 8 & 34). Whereas Men were mostly busy playing football or Ping-Pong,
reading newspapers, fixing the car, swimming, finding a new job, buying different things, etc. Males as breadwinners
were always involved in buying things. The verb buy thus always collocated with a male agent.
Overall, the two textbooks investigated overrepresented male characters both linguistically and visually in frequency
and order of occurrence, occupation, stereotypical activities, and the linguistic manifestation of masculine generic
referents.
Sexism, it seems, is so deeply ingrained in our culture, our language, and our subconscious that it is difficult for us
to avoid it in the production of language teaching materials (Florent et. al. 1989: 183 in Vogli 2009). And the
question is how come gender bias reviews and critiques of the Iranian EFL materials throughout all these years have
been left unnoticed and for almost 20 years or so the very same unmodified biased high school materials have been
published and republished over and over again without the slightest change.
6. Implications
One implication of this study might be to raise awareness and consciousness in EFL material developers regarding
gender prejudiced materials so as to help them initiate modifications regarding such inequities after almost 20 years
of publishing the same gender-bias loaded materials with no change. Material developers and curriculum designers
should pay attention to and consider the guidelines of gender-fair material development. There are several working
guidelines in literature including On Balance (Florent et. al., 1994), Guidelines for Non-exist Use of Language in
NCTE Publications, prepared by the National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) in 1985 and the Guidelines
for Gender-fair Use of Language published by The Women in Literacy and Life Assembly (WILLA) in 2002
(Mukundan and Nimehchisalem 2008).
Teachers, in addition, if made aware can deal with gender-biased materials logically and present them in an unbiased
way (Sunderland et. al., 2001). They can select their own teaching materials with more care if allowed and if needed
‘where the input of the course book reflects sexist practices or attitudes, … comment on them. Critical reading and
listening may thus become regular part of the suggested pedagogy’ (Sunderland 1992:87). They should also beware
not to attribute any specific roles, domestic or societal to either gender so as not to inculcate any preconceptions in
the learners (Mineshima 2008).
