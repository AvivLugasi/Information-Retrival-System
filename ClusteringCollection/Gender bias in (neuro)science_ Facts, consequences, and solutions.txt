IN T RO D U C T ION

Women neuroscientists (please note that we refer to all who
identify as such) are still underrepresented in various aspects of academic life. The efforts of the community to mitigate this issue are growing but can elicit adverse reactions
(Moghaddam & Gur, 2016). In this opinion paper, we discuss
the different approaches that have been taken at institutional,
organizational, and individual levels to counter gender bias
and aim at addressing unfavorable comments. We base our
reasoning on empirical data and on the feedback received
after the release of the Women in Neuroscience Repository
(WiNRepo, see Supporting information Table S1.a), an initiative we created to increase the visibility of women in neuroscience. While this feedback originated mainly from oral
conversations and was not rigorously quantified, we believe
the frequency of the comments justify their discussion, as
performed in (Moghaddam & Gur, 2016). The aim of this
piece (supported by a list of signatories, see Supporting

related to gender bias and to affirmative actions in academia,
as well as to propose concrete measures that can been implemented to counter such bias.

FACTS
“All this is not necessary”

The first feedback we received was that ‘all this’—referring to
actions promoting awareness such as repositories of women
in science or awards for women in Science, Technology,
Engineering and Mathematics (STEM)—was not necessary
as gender bias is behind us. Unfortunately, as discussed in
the next sections, there is ample evidence that gender bias
is still present in neuroscience and that women's careers and
the community as a whole could benefit from a more diverse
field.
While proportions of students in STEM at the undergraduate level are roughly similar between men and women, the
gap between male and female representation increases with
seniority of the position (Schiermeier, 2018; Shen, Webster,

F I G U R E 1 Histogram of proportions (in percentage) of women (green) and men (gray) in different aspects of neuroscientific academic life:
first and last journal authors (n = 1,760, considering 176 journals over 10 years: 2009–2018), prize awardees (n = 23), seminar speakers (n = 38,
considering 8 seminars over the academic years 2012 to 2016), and conference speakers as invited or contributed talks (n = 295 conferences
between 2015 and 2018)

Shoda, & Fine, 2018). In addition, women are paid less
given the same degree and field of work as men (Barbezat
& Hughes, 2005; Ministry for Women, 2018). For example,
in 2017, the gender pay gap at University College London
was 17.5%, close to the national average of 18% (University
College London, 2017); this gap being partly driven by a
lower proportion of women in senior roles (only 37% women
in the higher quartile pay grade). This evidence illustrates
that there are fewer women at senior positions in academia
and that they are typically paid less than their male peers
(Joëls & Mason, 2014).
Multiple and complex contributing factors interplay to
drive this gender discrepancy at senior levels (Shen et al.,
2018). Among those, the rate of career switching is higher
for female postdoctoral researchers who are planning to (or
already) have children than for men in similar circumstances
(Goulden, Frasch, & Mason, 2009). Women might also encounter a number of additional obstacles, preventing them
from reaching more senior positions (Bain & Cummings,
2000). These include: a lower acceptance rate for papers with
a female last author (Murray et al., 2018), lower recognition
of their contribution (Feldon, Peugh, Maher, Roksa, & Tofel-­
Grehl, 2017; Macaluso, Larivière, Sugimoto, & Sugimoto,
2016), lower acceptance rate for funding (Kaatz et al., 2016;
Pohlhaus, Jiang, Wagner, Schaffer, & Pinn, 2011; Sheltzer,
2018), lower rate of invitation to conferences or workshops
(Nittrouer et al., 2018; Supporting information Table S1.b),
and lower chances of being hired for tenure-­track positions
at the same competence level (Steinpreis, Anders, & Ritzke,
1999). Part of these obstacles may be further sustained by
the underrepresentation of women in the peer-­review process
(Murray et al., 2018) and on ‘deciding bodies’, as there is a
tendency for homophily, i.e., a same-­gender bias, for both men
and women (Helmer, Schottdorf, Neef, & Battaglia, 2017).
In neuroscience, this combination of factors leads to female underrepresentation in various aspects of academic
life (illustrated in Figure 1 and Supporting information
Data S1). Women author significantly less papers as first

(p = 3.9590e-­04) or last contributor (p < e-­20) than men.
They are awarded significantly fewer prizes (including
‘young investigator’ awards, p = 1.0539e-­05) and appear
significantly less as speakers in departmental seminar series
(p = 3.9355e-­
17) and conferences (invited or contributed
talks, p = 5.7349e-­80). These data illustrate the gap in female
representation between early and late career stages when
comparing proportions of female first (mean: 49.11%) and
last (mean: 31.32%) authors. While we are not disentangling
the causes of this underrepresentation, it is interesting to note
that since 2014 the rate of female trainees (students and postdocs) attending the Society for Neuroscience meeting oscillated between 49% and 50%, displaying a balanced pool of
young candidates. Over the same period, only 30%–32% of
faculty attendees were women, with no clear upwards trend.
Please see Supporting information Data S1 for details on data
collection and analysis.

CONSEQUENCES
“As long as the job is done...”

The second comment we received was “I don't really care if
there is a bias as long as the job is done.” Unfairness set apart,
this argument does not hold in research and academia. Indeed,
research is a creative process and the collective intelligence
of a group depends on the higher social sensitivity exhibited,
on average, by women (Woolley, Chabris, Pentland, Hashmi,
& Malone, 2010). Diverse teams have also been shown to
outperform homogeneous groups in innovation, flexibility,
problem-­solving, and decision-­making (King, 2005).
Underrepresention of a group may also have implications at the community level, as people tend to study people like them, to the detriment of other genders, classes,
and races that are part of our society. This becomes apparent in the medical field: for example, women's health
is understudied as women were less represented in (or

Summary of some actions (non-­exhaustive list) that can be taken at the institutional, organizational, and individual levels to
promote gender balance in the field
Institutions

Organizations

Individuals

• Actively collect and share data to define
and evaluate new policies
• Implement quotas (cascading model for
hires)
• Consider gender balance when awarding
prizes or fellowships (e.g., through tandem
nomination)
• Implement “stop-the-clock” policies for
parents
• Implement double-blind reviewing when
relevant (e.g., grant applications, journal
papers)
• Organize bias training sessions

• Favor diverse proposals
• Require gender-balanced nominations for
all organizing committees and reviewer
pools
• Search for candidates on lists or
repositories
• Consider gender balance when awarding
prizes or fellowships (e.g., through tandem
nomination)
• Provide childcare or other family-friendly
measures
• Implement double-blind reviewing for
paper submissions and awards

• Be aware of your own and others’ bias
• Speak out when observing gender-biased
events/behaviors
• Sign up on repositories or encourage
female colleagues to do so
• Submit recommendations for female
scientists (directly to organizations or on
repositories)
• Attend bias training sessions

even excluded from) clinical trials (Vlassoff, 2007). In
addition, the results of many neuroimaging studies come
from target populations of highly educated White people
(LeWinn, Sheridan, Keyes, Hamilton, & McLaughlin,
2017). Assessing and preventing bias is important not only
for the affected groups but also for the population as a
whole: studying female and male groups separately instead
of mixed in (un)equal proportions would highlight specific
traits in each gender (Holdcroft, 2007). Ensuring adequate
representation of diverse groups and studying the effects
of gender (among other variables) on the phenomenon of
interest can thus improve treatments and prevention techniques for all.
As a result of existing human biases, artificial intelligence
is biased as well. When trained on a large corpus of text, a
machine learning model will associate man with doctor and
woman with nurse, or man with engineer and woman with
homemaker (Bolukbasi, Chang, Zou, Saligrama, & Kalai,
2016). A new field of research is now dedicated to try to correct
for this bias (Supporting information Table S1.c). As machine
learning for health data is becoming increasingly popular, we
need to ensure that the same type of bias (e.g., due to biased
experimental designs) will not influence the model's outcome
as this would limit the use of such technology in ‘real’ clinical
settings. Therefore, not only should we aim at resolving the bias
issue but we also need to remember past biases to avoid their
incorporation into future technologies.

Addressing gender bias would thus be beneficial for science and academia. Solutions have been proposed to tackle
different aspects of gender bias at the institutional, organizational, and individual levels. Some of them are summarized in Table 1 and discussed below. We focus on actions

that have been or can easily be implemented by the neuroscience community, while acknowledging that these are
only partial solutions to the global and complex issue of
gender bias.

4.1

|

At the institutional level

Universities, funding agencies, and scientific journals
have an important role to play (Asplund & Welle, 2018).
For instance, institutes and universities can organize bias
training sessions for male and female scientists to raise
awareness (Asplund & Welle, 2018). They can also favor
work-­
life balanced environments (Supporting information Table S1.d) and take childbearing into account when
awarding fellowships or hiring (e.g., through “stop-­the-­
clock” policies, Supporting information Table S1.e) as
women typically have a larger responsibility in pregnancy
and breastfeeding, but also in caretaking due to biological, prejudicial, and often socially driven childcare demands (Calisi, 2018). Scientific journals can implement
double-­blind reviewing to mitigate any potential gender
bias during peer review (Bernard, 2018; Budden et al.,
2008). All institutions can also collect and share data on
various aspects of their functioning (e.g., student enrollment, reviewing panels, etc.) to establish new policies to
drive gender balance.
One popular strategy in this respect is to introduce gender
quotas. These are regulations that require a certain proportion of women in a given position (e.g., percentage of new
hires over a certain period of time, invited speakers at conferences, winners of an award). Quotas can be binding (i.e.,
with consequences in case of noncompliance) or voluntary
(also referred to as targets), implicit or explicit. They were
introduced in various domains of the general society (e.g., in
politics (Besley, Folke, Persson, & Rickne, 2017)) to counterbalance male dominance. As in all processes that aim at

  

SCHROUFF et al.

correcting a bias, a larger counter-­effect needs to be imposed
to obtain equilibrium. In this sense, quotas have also been
referred to as ‘positive discrimination’ or ‘affirmative action’
and are seen as a temporary process to obtain gender balance
after a ‘transition period’.
In academia, quotas can be implemented in a variety of
ways (Wallon, Bendiscioli, & Garrnkel, 2015; Supporting
information Table S1.f). For example, a cascading model
can be encouraged for new hires, where the quotas reflect the
proportions of female candidates at the level below the open
position (e.g., proportions of postdoctoral researchers define
quotas for lectureships). Fellowship schemes can require tandem nominations, where each institution must suggest two
candidates for a fellowship, one being a woman (Supporting
information Table S1.g). Quotas have elicited many reactions, which we discuss below.

4.1.1

|

Quotas are unfair

This type of comment reveals a deeper concern: will these
measures lead to the opposite situation, where women are favored independently of their skill levels? This concern may
also be associated with a fear of increased competition.
As mentioned above, women face more obstacles as
compared to their male counterparts, which tends to result
in less competitive resumes. In addition, women might underestimate their scientific competence (Dunning, Johnson,
Ehrlinger, & Kruger, 2003) and therefore their resumes may
misrepresent their qualification/experience when compared
to a man's. Furthermore, skill judgment is subjective: studies
have shown that with identical resumes, men will be assessed
as more qualified and hirable than women (Moss-­Racusin,
Dovidio, Brescoll, Graham, & Handelsman, 2012; Steinpreis
et al., 1999; Wennerås & Wold, 1997). These findings suggest that favoring a woman over a man with ‘equal competence’ might mean to hire the best candidate.
The fear about increased competition is understandable:
with more women scientists being visible, there are more
suitable candidates for the same job. However, a case study on
Swedish politics has shown that qualified men were not displaced (Besley et al., 2017). Hence, quotas and the increased
presence of women on the job market should not worry men
that are a good fit for the job in question. Furthermore, the
introduction of quotas led to an increase in the overall level of
competence (Besley et al., 2017), suggesting that quotas can
be beneficial for the project/institution as a whole.

4.1.2

|

Was I selected because of the quotas?

This point was specifically made by women scientists: quotas tend to hurt their self-­confidence, as the value of their
work may be questioned, and the reason for their success be

|

3097

attributed to their gender (also mentioned in Moghaddam and
Gur (2016)). Unfortunately, we do not have the answer to this
question. However, given the evidence discussed above, it is
unlikely that an unqualified woman would be given an opportunity. We would also like to stress that, whatever caused
the opportunity, women in positions of power can act as role
models, which would eventually attract more women and
lead to a more diverse field.
Quotas are a popular measure in place to increase diversity in institutions. They are now also present at the organizational level, especially at conferences.

4.2 | At the organizational level—
Conferences
Diversity of speakers is becoming a criterion in the selection of
keynote lectures, symposia, workshops, or educational courses
at conferences. Typically, no well-­defined numbers or proportions of female speakers are enforced, but proposals with an
appropriate representation of minorities are favored (see e.g.,
Society for Neuroscience call for symposia, Organization for
Human Brain Mapping educational courses). Organizers are
however not always able to submit proposals that are diverse in
gender. The reasons cited are multiple:

4.2.1 | There are not many female scientists
in this field
As mentioned before, there are indeed fewer women at senior positions than men. Many would however still be suitable
candidates as invited speakers, program committee members,
etc. despite their low visibility. To help with this issue, multiple initiatives have been created, mostly as lists or repositories
of women in science. In brain science, more than 1,500 women
from all countries and levels of seniority are registered on the
following lists: Anne's list (Supporting information Table S1.h),
Women in Brain stimulation (Supporting information Table
S1.i), 500 women scientists (Supporting information Table S1.j),
or our WiNRepo (Supporting information Table S1.a). We believe these resources can be helpful when searching for suitable
female candidates but acknowledge that using repositories requires more effort (finding candidates, checking their references
and publications) than sending an invitation to someone already
known in the field. To mitigate this issue, some initiatives (e.g.,
WiNRepo) now include a ‘recommendation system’, where all
scientists can leave a comment after having attended a talk by a
female neuroscientist member of the repository.

4.2.2

|

All the women we invited declined

As female scientists are less visible, it is likely that the same
people are repeatedly solicited and thus will decline some

3098

|

  

of the invitations (Moghaddam & Gur, 2016). Nonetheless,
women were shown not to decline more talk invitations than
men (Nittrouer et al., 2018). We recommend inviting women
that are outside the small circle of repeatedly solicited scientists to avoid this potential situation (e.g., using repositories).
Mentioning the specific scientific contribution that elicited
the invitation could potentially help avoid the question “Why
was I invited?”. More generally, highlighting the suitability
of the scientific, professional, or educational background of
the researcher for the symposium or educational event could
help clarify the legitimacy and relevance of the speaker's inclusion for attendees and invited researchers.
Quotas should be considered not only when inviting keynote speakers to an event: nominations for the organizing
committee should be gender-­balanced, as well as for the reviewer pool, and for awarding prizes. The decision-­making
structures need to include (at least) a female representation
that reflects the current base rate in the field for these measures to have a lasting impact. We however acknowledge that
this might lead to an extra work burden for the senior female
scientists who will be requested to sit on multiple panels and
committees (Vernos, 2013). While we hope that the imperfect solution of quotas is temporary, when successfully implemented (preferentially in combination with other affirmative
actions), they can lead to a more diverse representation (Irish
Research Council, 2018; Moghaddam & Gur, 2016).

4.2.3 | Break down the barrier for
women attendance
Attendance of women in scientific international events is
crucial for networking, visibility, and dissemination, key
steps that underlie the development of a research career.
However, the critical period encountered in the “junior” career stage frequently coincides with the period of early childcare for young parents and of pregnancy and breastfeeding
for women. The difficulties for parents, in particular women,
to attend conferences have been highlighted several times.
Calisi and a Working Group of Mothers in Sciences (2018)
have discussed these difficulties and already made concrete
suggestions referred to as “CARE” for (a) Childcare, (b)
Accommodate families, (c) Resources, (d) Establish social
networks. Offering childcare at conferences is the first and
probably the most important recommendation for conference organizations. We however acknowledge that the cost of
childcare facilities can make it unaffordable for many small
conferences. Independently of childcare facilities, all conferences should accommodate families, for example, by promoting children's attendance at conference dinners. Additional
facilities should be organized for breastfeeding women,
such as dedicated rooms and fridges for expressed milk. The
Society for Neuroscience conference can be pointed out as
an example of fruitful endeavor in that regard (Grens, 2017).

SCHROUFF et al.

Finally, while all those facilities require small or larger financial/material investment, conferences can organize social
networks platforms for parents to self-­help as a community.
Such platforms have the additional benefit of becoming a networking opportunity for scientists with young children. In addition to these four measures, we would recommend avoiding
organizing events during critical school periods (e.g., beginning of the academic year) as much as possible.
Overall, we have presented several complementary initiatives as solutions at the institutional and organizational levels. Nevertheless, society cannot evolve at the institutional
level without parallel evolution of individuals’ mindset and
effort. A collective is made of individuals, who each have the
ability to raise awareness on gender bias and foster diversity
in their organization.

4.3

|

At the individual level

All scientists can contribute to a more diverse field. In practice,
most of us are implicitly subject to biases (Asplund & Welle,
2018; Raymond, 2013). A first and key step is to be aware of
our (see Supporting information Table S1.k for a free online
test) and others’ biases and act accordingly. Women can register on repositories to improve their visibility and should consider accepting opportunities that might have been triggered by
a diversity search. While this might feel uncomfortable, such
opportunities are great career advancements and the occasion
to act as role model for the future generations.
In addition, all scientists can speak up when observing
gender-­biased events or behaviors. For instance, when invited to an event, one can check the diversity in the organization and target audience of the event. Both men and women
have declined to speak at certain gender-­biased events (see
these pledges, Supporting information Table S1.l). In this
case, we believe the answer should be constructive, with a
list of suggested female candidates. We also found that using
interrogation could communicate the issue without being accusing (e.g., “I cannot locate the name of the women speaking at this event. Are you still awaiting responses?”).
To ease the selection of speakers for events or other opportunities, one can also consider submitting recommendations for female scientists directly to organizations or on
repositories, as the WiNRepo.
Beyond conference organization, diversity should also be
promoted for other scientific activities, such as when looking for collaborators for projects or in grant writing. When
declining invitations (e.g., talks or peer-­reviewing articles),
we suggest recommending male and female alternative candidates equally often.
Some organizations or individuals have also launched specific initiatives to target gender bias in their field. A successful example is the Women in Machine Learning Workshop
(Supporting information Table S1.m) that evolved from a

All female events

It is however easy with events targeting gender bias to encounter an opposite problem: male underrepresentation. While
potentially beneficial for women (especially in terms of networking), women-­only events are not optimally designed to
address the issue of implicit gender bias. Indeed, discussing
gender bias with only the affected community cannot solve the
problem (Parmar, 2013). Such events also tend to exclude male
attendees, whereas there are still many more men in positions
of power. Ignoring the difference these men could make if they
were promoting diversity in their field is hindering changes in
this direction. Thus, both men and women could foster progress by attending such events.

CO NC LU SION

We have outlined evidence showing the existence of a gender
bias in (neuro)science and proposed some possible solutions
at different levels. Whether action is taken at the institutional, organizational, or individual level, we would like to
emphasize that addressing gender bias should always be approached in a non-­blaming manner, unless in the case of clear
misconduct or conscious discrimination. Non-­constructive or
blaming statements, whether true or not, only hurt the discussion. We, the present generation of neuroscientists, men
and women alike, have the responsibility to provide a field of
equal opportunities for the upcoming generations.
Finally, we would like to conclude on a positive note: although there is still a long way to go to change the male dominant culture (Holman, Stuart-­Fox, & Hauser, 2018), there is
a rise in awareness of the problem and the situation is slowly

improving (Joëls & Mason, 2014; Figure 2). We firmly believe that pursuing the current efforts while bringing men and
women together will be the key toward a fairer and more creative research community.
