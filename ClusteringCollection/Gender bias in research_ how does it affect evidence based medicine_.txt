The evidence basis of medicine may be fundamentally flawed because there is an ongoing failure of research tools to
include sex differences in study design and analysis. The reporting bias which this methodology maintains creates a
situation where guidelines based on the study of one sex may be generalized and applied to both. In fact, study
design in the 1970s in response to sex discrimination legislation made efforts to mix gender within study groups since
this was considered the best approach to equality.
Although significant social progress has been made since then, the application of the principles behind the
legislation to women's health and gender-based research have not been so positive. Those who research gender
issues in clinical and laboratory medicine are aware of significant barriers both for researchers and for subjects
entering studies. This is one illustration of continuing deep-seated patterns of disadvantage that triggered an equalities
review by the UK Cabinet Office in November 2005. For example, research funding for coronary artery disease in
men is far greater than for women, yet the at risk population of women, which is an older age group, suffers more
morbidity and mortality. The lack of funding for women's disease in effect maintains women's lower economic status.
It can also hinder research into gender medicine where significant advances in the diagnosis and management of
coronary artery disease have built up from small differences into major gender medicine issues.1 Clinical research
also exhibits gender bias in other areas. One of these is in recruitment into clinical trials;2 another is the reporting of
gender-related data.3 However, there is a dearth of gender-based clinical research from within the UK. Thus it is
pertinent to use studies from North America and Europe where these issues have been investigated.
It was in 1994 that the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) issued a guideline for the study and evaluation of
gender differences in clinical trials to ensure that the safety and efficacy of drugs would be adequately investigated in
the full range of patients who would use the therapy.4 Prior to this policy, women had been excluded from early
studies of most drugs—mainly for safety reasons, but this prohibition meant there was little information about the
effects of drugs in women. For example, women may have a different drug efficacy or side effect profile to men.5 It
was reported in 2005 that eight out of ten prescription drugs were withdrawn from the US market because of
women's health issues.6 This represents an enormous waste of research money as a consequence of neglecting
gender research. The aims of the NIH guidance were to recruit enough women into studies to be able to allow valid
analyses of differences in intervention effect, to evaluate the risks and benefits in women, and to provide
opportunities for women to contribute to research through active participation in clinical trials while preventing
exposure of a fetus to a toxic drug. Since then, in the USA, women can enter phase one, two and three clinical trials.

Furthermore, training for and monitoring adherence to this policy has been undertaken by the NIH through the
review process for research funding. However there has not been a dramatic recruitment of women's data into trial
results.7
Monitoring for gender in NIH research has been reported from the US Congress Office. In 1997, 94% of grant
proposals included women as research subjects.8 This high figure, however, belies the underlying Society for
Women's Health Research data that the richest charities (as distinct from government funded bodies) were not
progressing with the inclusion of women as researchers and subjects and that only 3% of grant proposals measured
sex differences.6 One important methodological barrier appears to be that women using hormonal contraception
must be considered as a separate group for purposes of analysis.9 However, even the basic concept of including
women, whatever their hormonal status, has been brought into focus by recent studies that identified significant
barriers to the inclusion of women in clinical trials.
Questions concerning contraceptive use in clinical trials were investigated by an Institutional Board survey. These
trials were mainly government sponsored in the years after gender discrimination was outlawed. It was found that
certification of contraceptive use was required in 42% of protocols without explanation and in 36% of protocols
because of the study drug used.10 Almost 10% of protocols allowed no exclusions for contraceptive use (e.g.
celibacy or sexual orientation). In addition, for the inclusion of women, up to four counter-signatures were required
in some studies to confirm contraceptive use, whereas for men no signatures were required. The study concluded
that access to studies by women created burdens that were disproportionate to men. Aspects of contraceptive
requirements for studies that did not appear to have been considered by researchers or ethics committees included
the risks of contraceptives, interference with drug metabolism by hormonal contraception,11 that partners may be
sterile, that fetal harm may also affect men, that the risk of fetal exposure to one dose of a drug was minimal and that
women could make their own decisions.
A similar study in Sweden from 1997–1999 investigated why researchers excluded women from clinical trials.2
The scientific reasons for excluding women were a lack of physiological data, repeat of studies that had previously
used only men so as to obtain comparable data, and the economic costs of research in women. This latter problem
has been highlighted in a recent publication by the Society for Women's Health Research, where the guidelines
advise that for research into sex differences the best standards for women are to use different hormonal states.11
The economic costs of this ‘gold standard’ methodology have the potential to quadruple medical research grant
costs.12
Another facet of gender bias in research is in the lack of incorporation of gender data into evidence-based
medicine. For example, despite well recognized gender differences in coronary heart disease management in UK
critical care units,13 the UK NHS guidelines for management are not gender specific.14 If research lacks or excludes
female subjects then; he guidelines should clearly state that the evidence has been obtained mainly from men. In
addition, the context in which the evidence basis for medicine is drawn is also questionable because the factors that
contribute to women's health (or lack of it) such as poverty and social deprivation will not be the same as for men.
These differences need to be defined in order for guidance to reflect the social context of disease. Furthermore, the
outputs of biased guidance can influence education, both in terms of what is taught (i.e. maintenance of the status
quo) and who teaches it (e.g. gender bias in training) so that inequality is perpetuated.
In a recent NHS and Medical Research Council assessment of the causes and effects of socio-demographic
exclusions of women from clinical trials, statins and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were
investigated.15 The two drugs demonstrated a dramatic difference in the gender of subjects included in trials.
Whereas studies of NSAIDs reflected the population in which they were used, those for statins did not and only
16% of women were included in trials compared with 45% who were using statins. The authors of this study
identified the neglect of gender issues in UK research and recommended facilitators to be identified to remove
barriers to researchers and women. Including women in clinical studies recognizes that the population is not

homogenous, research should benefit all people, protective policies may exclude the people most at risk and
exclusion accords a lower status to women.
With the advent of gender medicine as a specialty that is developing across the world, a woman's reproductive
status, menstrual cycle and contraceptive history has become significant in studying health, disease and
pharmacology. In the UK we should seize the opportunity to implement best practices for health care research
across genders and to establish gender specific evidence based guidance.
