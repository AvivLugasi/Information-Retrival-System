Abstract: Hedyotis diffuse Willd. (HD) and Hedyotis corymbosa (L.) Lam. (HC), two closely related
species of the same genus, are both used for health benefits and disease prevention in China. HC is
also indiscriminately sold as HD in the wholesale chain and food markets. This confusion has led to
a growing concern about their identification and quality evaluation. In order to further understand
the molecular diversification between them, we focus on the screening of chemical components
and the analysis of non-targeted metabolites. In this study, UPLC-QTOF-MSE, UNIFI platform and
multivariate statistical analyses were used to profile them. Firstly, a total of 113 compounds, including
80 shared chemical constituents of the two plants, were identified from HC and HD by using the UNIFI
platform. Secondly, the differences between two herbs were highlighted with the comparative analysis.
Asa result, a total of 33 robust biomarkers enabling the differentiation were discovered by using
multivariate statistical analyses. For HC, there were 18 potential biomarkers (either the contents were
much greater than in HD or being detected only in HC) including three iridoids, eight flavonoids, two
tannins, two ketones, one alcohol and two monoterpenes. For HD, there were15 potential biomarkers
(either the contents were much greater than in HC or being detected only in HD) including two
iridoids, eight flavonoids, one tannin, one ketone, and three anthraquinones. With a comprehensive
consideration of the contents or the MS responses of the chemical composition, Hedycoryside
A and B, detected only in HC, could be used for rapid identification of HC. The compounds
1,3-dihydroxy-2-methylanthraquinone and 2-hydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone, detected only in HD,
could be used for rapid identification of that plant. The systematic comparison of similarities and
differences between two confusing Chinese herbs will provide reliable characterization profiles to
clarify the pharmacological fundamental substances. HC should not be used as the substitute of HD.

1. Introduction

Hedyotis diffuse Willd. (HD) is a well-known Chinese folk-medicine with a spectrum of
pharmacological activities, including anti-cancer, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibroblast,
immunomodulatory and neuroprotective effects, especially the anti-cancer effect in practice [1].

Molecules 2018, 23, 1525; doi:10.3390 / molecules23071525 www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules
Molecules 2018, 23, 1525 2 of 24

Almost 200 compounds have been identified in HD, including iridoids, flavonoids, anthraquinones,
phenylpropanoids, phenolics and their derivatives, sphingolipids, volatile oils and miscellaneous
compounds [1-3].

Hedyotis corymbosa (L.) Lam. (HC), another species of the same genus, is also used interchangeably
in China as a health supplement and for disease prevention. It is reported to possess antioxidant [4,5],
anti-inflammatory [6], hepatoprotective [7,8], antitumor [9,10], antimalarial [11] and anti-nociceptive [12]
activities. Iridoids, carboxylic acids, flavonoids, phenolics and their derivatives, triterpenes,
anthranquinones and coumarins were isolated from HC [13-15]. Iridoid glycosides were reported
as the main constituents [16]. Oleanolic acid and ursolic acid were also considered as biologically active
ingredients [17,18].

HD and HC are closely related species of the Rubiaceae family. Due to their similar morphology,
they are often mixed up. Recently, a systematic survey on confusable Chinese herbal medicines
has revealed that HC is indiscriminately sold as HD in wholesale markets or food markets [19].
This confusion in the market has led to a growing concern about the identification and quality
evaluation of HD and HC.

Several methods using various techniques have been established to distinguish between these
two species, such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification technique (LAMP) [20], fluorescence
microscopy [21], thin layer chromatography (TLC) [22], DNA sequencing of the complete internal
transcribed spacer region and chemical analysis [23], phylogenetic utility of nuclear ribosomal
DNA (nrDNA) internal transcribed spacers (ITS) [24], high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) [25], etc. As a result, markers such as hedyotiscone A [22], scandoside methyl] ester [25],
(9R,10S,7E)-6,9,10-trihydroxyoctadec-7-enoic acid [26] for HC, 6-O-(E)-p-coumaroyl scandoside methy]
ester [23,25], (10S)-hydroxypheophytin a [23], 6-O-(E)-p-coumaroyl] scandoside methy] ester-10-methy]
ether and 6-O-p-feruloyl scandoside methyl ester [25] for HD have been found. The UPLC-UV
(detection wavelength at 254 nm) fingerprint of HC was also established to distinguish it from HD [27].
The contents of oleanolic acid and ursolic acid were significantly different [28].

Untargeted metabolomics, with the ability to profile diverse classes of metabolites, is primarily
used to compare the overall small-molecule metabolites of different samples [29]. It is mainly applied
in metabolites identification through mass-based search strategy followed by manual or automated
verification. The combination of ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) separation,
quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (Q/TOF-MS) detection and the automated
data processing software UNIFI with a scientific library is frequently applied in the characterization
of chemical constituents of herbal medicines [30-33] and traditional Chinese medicine injection
recently [34]. High-resolution tandem mass spectrum can provide an accurate and specific mass when
the coeluting components possess different m/z values. UNIFI, a high throughput, comprehensive,
simple and efficient platform, offers the approach to integrate data acquisition, data mining, library
searching and report generation. The Traditional Medicine Library within the platform contains more
than 6000 compounds from 600 herbs.

The aim of the study was search for potential biomarkers in order to systematically screen
chemical components and the non-targeted metabolomic analysis of the two species, and in turn
providing the basis for establishment of HC and HD quality criterion in the future. UPLC-QTOE-MSE,
UNIFI platform and multivariate statistical analyses, such as principal component analysis (PCA)
and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were used to profile these two
herbs. The established method could enable us to find the similarities and differences between
them, and provide data for the establishment of HC and HD quality criterion in the future.
This comprehensive and unique phytochemical profile study revealed the structural diversity of
secondary metabolites and the different patterns in HC and HD. The method developed in this study
can be used as a standard protocol for identifying and discriminating species of HC and HD.

2. Experimental

2.1. Materials and Reagents

HC and HD were purchased from herbal markets or collected from their respective cultivation
areas in China (Table 1). The corresponding voucher specimens had been deposited in the Research
Center of Natural Drug, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jilin University, China. All the HC and HD
samples were identified with the macroscopic and microscopic characters according to the Standard of
Chinese Medicinal Materials in Guangdong Province (2004 Edition) and the Standard of Chinese Medicinal
Materials in Shaanxi Province (2015 Edition). In these Standards, the identified methods only focus on
the different macroscopic and microscopic characters. As the chemical constitutes are concerned, both
oleanolic acid and ursolic acid are used to quality control. That is to say, there are no biomarkers to
distinguish HC from HD.

2.2. Sample Preparation and Extraction

All the whole plants, including HC (HC1~HC10) and HD (HD1~HD10), were air-dried, grinded
and sieved (40 mesh) to get the homogeneous powder respectively. Then, the powder of 20 samples
(200 mg per sample) were extracted respectively with 80% methanol (2L x 3) at 80 °C for three times
(3 heach time) with the reflux method. The extraction procedure is repeated until the extracted solution
is colorless. After filteration, the extracts of each sample were combined, concentrated and evaporate
to dryness. As a result, 20 desiccated extract powders were obtained. Each powder was dissolved in
1.0 mL of 80% methanol. Subsequently, each methanolic solution was filtered and injected directly
into the UPLC system. The volume injected of each sample was 2 uL for each run. Furthermore,
the methanol blank were run with the same gradient program between two samples during the whole
sample list. The wash volume between injections was enough for avoiding carry over. Meanwhile,
20-uL aliquots of each HD and HC sample were mixed to obtain a quality control (QC) sample, which
contained all of the components in the analysis. The QC sample was run every five samples to monitor
the stability of the system.

2.3. Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatography with Quadrupole Time-of-Flight Tandem Mass
Spectrometry (LUIPLC-QTOF-MS)

The separation and MS detection of components were performed on a Waters Xevo G2-XS
QTOF mass spectrometer (Waters Co., Milford, MA, USA) connected to the UPLC system through an
electrospray ionization (ESI) interface. UV wavelength did not trigger the MS detection of components.
The column used was an ACQUITY UPLC BEH Cjg (100 mm x 2.1 mm, 1.7 um) from Waters
Corporation (Milford, MA, USA). The mobile phases consisted of eluent A (0.1% formic acid in water,
v/v) and eluent B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile, v/v) with a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min following a
liner gradient program: 10% B from 0 to 2 min, 10-90% B from 2 to 25 min, 90% B from 25 to 26 min
and 90-10% B from 26 to 26.1 min. The temperature of the UPLC column and sample was set at 30 °C
and 15 °C. Mixtures of 10/90 and 90/10 water/acetonitrile were used as the strong wash and the weak
wash solvent respectively. The optimized instrumental parameters were as follows: capillary voltage
floating at 2.6 kV (ESI*) or 2.2 kV (ESI), cone voltage at 40 V, source temperature at 150 °C, desolvation
temperature at 400 °C, cone gas flow at 50 L/h and desolvation gas flow at 800 L/h. In MSE mode,
collision energy of low energy function was set to 6 V, while ramp collision energy of high energy
function was set to 20-40 V. Each sample was analyzed by UPLC-QTOF-MSE mode; data acquisition
was performed via the mass spectrometer by rapidly switching from a low-collision energy (CE) scan to
a high-CE scan during a single LC run. The low-CE experiment provides information about the intact
molecular ion, e.g., [M+H]*, while the high-CE scan generates fragment ion information. Alignment
of the low-CE and high-CE data is automatically performed by the software. To ensure mass accuracy
and reproducibility, the mass spectrometer was calibrated over a range of 100-1200 Da with sodium
formate. Leucine enkephalin was used as external reference of Lock Spray™ infused at a constant flow
of 10 uL/min. In addition, MassLynx data were recorded in continuous mode during acquisition.

2.4. Chemical Information Database for the Components of HC and HD

In addition to the Waters Traditional Medicine Library in the UNIFI software, a systematic
investigation of chemical constituents was conducted. A self-built database of compounds isolated
from HC and HD was established by searching online databases such as China Journals of Full-Text
Database (CNKI), PubMed, Medline, Web of Science and ChemSpider. The name, molecular formula
and structure of components from HC and HD were obtained in the database.

2.5. Data Analysis by UNIFI Platform

Data analysis was performed on UNIFI 1.7.0 software (Waters, Manchester, UK). Emphasis was
put on analyzing structural characteristics and MS fragmentation behaviors, especially for characteristic
Molecules 2018, 23, 1525 5 of 24

fragments. Minimum peak area of 200 was set for 2D peak detection. The peak intensity of high energy
over 200 counts and the peak intensity of low energy over 1000 counts were the selected parameters in
3D peak detection. A margin of error up to 5 ppm for identified compounds was allowed. We selected
positive adducts containing +H and +Na and negative adducts including +COOH and —H. For exact
mass accuracy, with leucine enkaplin as the reference compound, [M+H]* 556.2766 was used for
positive ion and [M—H]~ 554.2620 was used for negative ion in the UNIFI platform.

The MS raw data were processed using the streamlined workflow of UNIFI software to quickly
identify the chemical components that met the match criteria with the Traditional Medicine Library.
Firstly, an in-house scientific library was created including the information of chemical components
from the target herbs based on the literature, saved as Mol file format, and then, the newly built library
was imported into the analysis method, in virtue of some compounds being missing in the Traditional
Medicine Library. Secondly, the raw data was compressed by Waters Compression and Archival
Tool v1.10 and imported into the software. Thirdly, automated screening and identification were
performed by the UNIFI platform instead of manually extracting each individual chromatographic
peak, calculating the elementary composition and then analyzing MS fragmentation behaviors.
Fourthly, we set up a filter to refine results, being mass error between —5 and 5 ppm, and additionally,
response value greater than 6000. Finally, further verification of compounds by comparison with
retention time of reference substances and characteristic MS fragmentation patterns reported in
literature was carried out. After processing and filtering of the data by UNIFI, all selected components
were listed for further verification, including information such as compound name, chemical structure,
mass error, adducts, response, extracting ion chromatograms and spectra of low energy and high
energy. The components were listed by descending response order and confirmed by reference
substances or comparison with literatures.

2.6. Metabonomics Analysis

MarkerLynx XS V4.1 software (Waters, Manchester, UK) was used to process the raw data for
alignment, deconvolution, data reduction, etc. As a result, the list of mass and retention time pairs
with corresponding intensities for all the detected peaks from each data file. The main parameters were
as follows: retention time range 0-26 min, mass range 100-1200 Da, mass tolerance 0.10, minimum
intensity 5%, marker intensity threshold 2000 counts, mass window 0.10, retention time window 0.20,
and noise elimination level 6. Furthermore, also with the MarkerLynx XS V4.1 software, principle
component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis
(OPLS-DA) were applied to analyze the above resulting data. Whether these two species are different
would depend on the separation between HD and HC groups. The obvious separation in PCA score
plots means they are differentiated. The supervised pattern recognition approach OPLS-DA can
visualize and depict general metabolic variation between two groups. To identify the metabolites
contributing to the discrimination, S-plots and VIP-plots were obtained via OPLS-DA analysis to find
potential biomarkers that significantly contributed to the difference among HC and HD. Each spot in
S-plots represents a variance. The importance of each variance to classification is determined by the
value of variable importance in the projection (VIP) and metabolites with VIP value above 2.0 were
considered as potential markers.

3. Results

3.1. Identification of Components from HC and HD

A total of 113 compounds were identified or tentatively characterized in both positive and
negative mode from HC and HD (Table 2), the base peak intensity (BPI) chromatograms are shown in
Figure 1, and their chemical structures are shown in Figure 2. In HC and HD 109 and 104 compounds
were characterized, respectively. Both herbs are rich in natural components with various structural
patterns, including iridoids, flavonoids, organic acids and organic acid esters, tannins, alcohols,
Molecules 2018, 23, 1525 6 of 24

ketones, coumarins, anthraquinones, monoterpenes, triterpenoids, etc. Some of these compounds have
isomers may be distinguished based on characteristic MS fragmentation patterns reported in literature,
or comparison of retention times to reference substances.

80 common constituents were identified from HC and HD. Among them, there were eleven
iridoids (compounds 6, 8, 11, 14, 18, 20, 29, 51, 53, 58 and 59), thirteen flavonoids (compounds 7,
17, 25, 26, 27, 31, 36, 37, 38, 39, 43, 56 and 61), one monoterpene (compound 10), one anthraquinone
(compound 68), two ketones (compounds 34 and 67), three tannins (compounds 4, 73 and 60), five
alcohols (compounds 13, 80, 82, 98 and 99), and the rest are organic acids and organic acid esters,
triterpenoids, coumarins, alkaloid, phenol, amide and glycoside. The contents of above components
were similar in these two herbs.

3.2. Biomarker Discovery for HD and HC

PCA, a classic unsupervised lowering-dimension pattern recognition model, can be used to select
distinct variables and to find potential biomarkers. It was firstly established based on the spectra
of HD and HC samples to discern the presence of inherent similarities in mass spectral profiles as
Molecules 2018, 23, 1525 15 of 24

displayed in Figure 3. Two parameters, R? (cum) and Q? (cum), are commonly used to assess the
quality of the PCA model, with values close to 1.0 indicative of good fitness and predictive ability.
In the present study, R?X (cum) and Q* (cum) were 0.6909 and 0.6257, respectively, indicating good
fitness and prediction of the constructed PCA model.

Figure 3. The PCA of HC and HD in positive mode (ESI*) and negative mode (ESI). HD: Hedyotis
diffuse Willd. HC: Hedyotis corynibosa (L.) Lam. QC: Quality Control.

Based on the obtained PCA score plots (Figure 3), the 20 samples were obviously divided into
two main groups according to different species (HD and HC). The HD samples were noticeably
overlapping, which indicates good similarity among them, and this result was also observed for HC
samples. Meanwhile, the HD group and the HC group were completely separated, indicating that
these two species herbs could be differentiated. The QC samples were between the two species, which
came from the fact that they were mixed volumetrically in 50%.

In order to distinguish HD from HC, OPLS-DA models were built in both positive and negative
modes. OPLS-DA score plot, S-plot, variable trend and VIP (variable importance in the projection)
values were obtained to understand which variables are responsible for separation [109].

As shown in Figure 4, OPLS-DA models were constructed to discriminate the difference under
the already established separation between different groups based on the PCA results. Each model
has 2 score components (HD and HC). These scores are weighted averages of the original ones, hence
providing a good summary. In addition, these scores display the separation of the groups in both
ESI* and ESI” modes. The scores t[1] (x-axis) and to[1] (y-axis) are the two most important new
variables in summarizing and separating the data. Each point in the plot corresponds to an observation.
The groups are shown in different shapes and the separation of the groups is easily visible in t[1].
The to[1] score values show the variation within each class. This variation can either be caused by
biological variation or by systematic changes in the experimental setup.

Figure 5 displays the variable importance (VIP) versus the PLS-regression coefficients. Important
X-variables have large positive VIP values and large positive or negative coefficient values.
The covariance p[1] and correlation p(corr)[1] loadings from a two class OPLS-DA model were
shown here in S-Plot format (Figure 6). The points are Exact Mass/Retention Time pairs (EMRTs).
The upper right quadrant of the S-plot shows those components which are elevated in HC, the control
group, while the lower left quadrant shows EMRTs elevated in HD, the treated group. The farther
along the x-axis the greater the contribution to the variance between the groups, while the farther
the y-axis the higher the reliability of the analytical result. Based on VIP values (VIP > 4) (Figure 5)
and p values (p < 0.05) [110] from univariate analysis, and the identification of components from HC
and HD (Table 2), 33 robust known biomarkers enabling the differentiation between HD and HC
were discovered and marked in S-plots (Figure 6). In order to systematically evaluate the biomarkers,
a heatmap was generated from these biomarkers (shown in Figure 7), which shows distinct segregation
between two species.

4, Discussion

There are 109 and 104 compounds characterized from HC and HD respectively. Sixty compounds
were identified in ESI” mode and 53 compounds were identified in ESI* mode. According to the BPI
chromatograms of HC and HD, it seems that ESI~ ionization mode is better than ESI* based on the
quantity and the responses of the identified compounds, but it is still necessary to run the ESI* mode
because some compounds showed better respond than in ESI~ mode.

It was revealed that HD and HC differed in their chemical composition according to the
HPLC analysis [19]. It was also indicated that 6-O-(E)-p-coumaroyl scandoside methyl ester and
6-O-(E)-p-coumaroyl] scandoside methyl ester-10-O-methyl ether were the main components of HD.
In 2007, Liang et al. reported that HD and its substitutes could be identified based on HPLC chemical
fingerprints and mass spectrometric analysis [25]. MS combined with UV spectra and literature
values was used to obtain the chemical information. As a result, four compounds, asperuloside,
6-O-(E)-p-coumaroyl scandoside methyl ester, 6-O-(E)-p-coumaroy] scandoside methy] ester-10-methy]
ester and 6-O-p-feruloyl scandoside methyl ester were recommended to be used as chemical markers
for quality evaluation and chemical authentication of HD and its substitutes. In addition, scandoside
methyl ester detected in the chromatograms of HC can be used as the characteristic peaks [25].
Furthermore, a previous report found that hedyotiscone A could be used to differentiate HC
from HD using TLC method [22]. In our study, asperuloside, 6-O-(E)-p-coumaroyl scandoside
methyl ester-10-methyl ester, scandoside methyl ester, 6-O-p-feruloyl scandoside methyl] ester and
hedyotiscone A were shared in HC and HD, but the reported result concerning 6-O-(E)-p-coumaroyl
scandoside methyl ester was consistent with our findings.

In the other record, another marker compound, 10(S)-hydroxypheophytin a, isolated with a yield
of 22 mg from 600 g of HC, was identified exclusively in HD [23]. It is a pity that it was not be
detected under our experimental conditions. Similarly, (9R,105,7E)-6,9,10-trihydroxyoctadec-7-enoic
acid, isolated with a yield of 47.9 mg from 20 kg of HC, was reported to be used to differentiate HC
from HD [26]. It was not be detected under our experimental conditions either.

In this study, 33 known compounds enabling the robust differentiation between HC and HD
were detected. For HC, there were 18 potential biomarkers, including three iridoids (23, 55, 66), eight
flavonoids (30, 35, 40, 42, 47, 71, 75, 81), two tannins (19, 45), two ketones (22, 91), one alcohol (92),
two monoterpenes (89, 90). Among these potential biomarkers, the contents of nine components
(19, 22, 23, 30, 35, 40, 45, 66, 92) in HC were much greater than in HD. Compounds 42, 47, 55, 71, 75,
81, 89, 90 and 91 could be detected only in HC. It’s worth mentioning that two iridoids, compounds 55
(hedycoryside B) and 66 (hedycoryside A), with high responses in UPLC-MS might be used for rapid
identification of HC. For HD, there were 15 potential biomarkers including two iridoids (52, 50), eight
flavonoids (41, 44, 49, 54, 57, 62, 79, 84), one tannin (46), one ketone (70), and three anthraquinones
(69, 77, 78). Among them, the contents of eleven components (41, 44, 46, 49, 52, 57, 62, 70, 77, 78,
79) in HD were much higher than those in HC. Compounds 50, 54, 69 and 84 were detected only in
HD. In addition, two anthraquinones, compounds 69 (1,3-dihydroxy-2-methylanthraquinone) and
78 (2-hydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone) with high responses in UPLC-MS might be used for rapid
identification of HD.

However, there are still some unresolved issues. Firstly, the pharmaceutical effects associated
with these identified compounds should be screened in the future. Secondly, as shown in BPI
chromatograms, though 113 compounds were identified, there are still some unidentified components.
Further research should be carried out based on the formula of these unknown compounds. Thirdly,
source material is not seasonable as it was collected during summer time. Fourthly, collecting HC and
HD in the same area may be the better way for comparison. But in this study, Haikou City for HC
and Fuzhou City for HD were visited. To some extent, the collection of these samples might be used
as negative controls for another species because it could eliminate the influence of the region on the
analysis of the sample. But unfortunately, the regional factor should not be considered as there should
be more samples per region.

5. Conclusions

Under the optimized conditions, a total of 109 chemical compounds with different structural
types were identified from HC and 104 from HD. The similarities and differences between these two
herbs were also highlighted in the paper. Various structural patterns including iridoids, flavonoids,
organic acids and organic acid esters, tannins, alcohols, ketones, coumarins, anthraquinones,
monoterpenes, triterpenoids were presenting in these two herbs, of which there were 80 shared
compounds in HC and HD. There is quite a difference in the parent structures types between HC
and HD. A total of 33 robust biomarkers enabling the differentiation between HC and HD were
discovered. For HC and HD, 18 and 15 potential biomarkers, respectively, were identified in this
paper. Two iridoids, hedycoryside B (compound 55) and hedycoryside A (66) might be used for rapid
identification of HC, and two anthraquinones, 1,3-Dihydroxy-2-methylanthraquinone (compound 69)
and 2-Hydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone (78) might be used for rapid identification of HD based on
their presence and content. Actually, these solid biomarkers are recommended for further use in the
recognition and distinction between HC and HD. The results provided reliable characterization
profiles to identify these two herbs and to clarify the fundamental pharmacological substances.
Different chemical compositions will inevitably lead to different biological effects of HC and HD
in clinical application. HC should not be used as substitute of HD. The results provided data on the
chemical constituents of HC and provide a reference for the quality control of HD in the aspect of
quantitative determination.
