Abstract

Gender differences in who gets recruited by political party elites contribute to women’s
underrepresentation on the ballot, but recent evidence suggests that even when women
are recruited at the same level as men, they are less likely to be interested in seeking
office. Why do men and women respond differently to invitations to seek office? We
hypothesize that women view party recruitment as a weaker signal of informal support
than men do. We use a survey experiment on a sample of 3,640 elected municipal
officeholders—themselves prospective recruits for higher office—to test this. We find
that female respondents generally believe party leaders will provide the women they
recruit less strategic and financial support than the men they recruit. In other words, even
when elites recruit women, women are skeptical that party leaders will use their political
and social capital on their behalf. This difference may account for many women’s
lukewarm responses to recruitment.
       Research on gender and candidate emergence points to the important role that

party recruitment plays in women’s representation on the ballot. Party elites tend to

recruit men more frequently and more intensely than women (Crowder-Meyer 2013; Fox

and Lawless 2010; Lawless and Fox 2010; Niven 1998a, 1998b). And, women are much

less likely than men to consider running in the absence of recruitment (Carroll and

Sanbonmatsu 2013a; Lawless and Fox 2010). For this reason, scholars have suggested

that gender-balanced party recruitment is an important way to increase the number of

female candidates (Carroll and Sanbonmatsu 2013a; Crowder-Meyer 2013; Fox and

Lawless 2010, 2010; Sanbonmatsu 2006a).

       At the same time, political practitioners regularly lament that women are much

more difficult to recruit than men (Sanbonmatsu 2006b). And, recent research confirms

that women tend to be less likely than men to respond positively to party recruitment

efforts (Preece and Stoddard 2015; Preece, Stoddard, and Fisher 2015). Hence, though

more gender-balanced recruitment by political parties and political elites may help, it is

unlikely to close the gap between men and women on the ballot. Closing the gap will

require a deeper examination of why women disproportionately shrug off party efforts to

encourage them to run for office.

       We hypothesize one reason for the gender gap in responses to recruitment is that

men and women have different perceptions about the extent to which recruitment implies

continued elite help and support throughout the campaign. Informal support from party

elites is crucial during both the “invisible primary” and general election. We consider

whether men view recruitment as a request to run and an implicit promise of future




                                                                                             1
campaign support, while women view recruitment as simply a request to run. We also

examine an even more worrying question: do women believe men who are recruited by

party leaders will receive future campaign support, while women who are recruited will

not? If either or both of these differences in perceptions about the meaning of recruitment

exist, it could help to explain why women are hesitant to run even when they have been

recruited by political elites.

        We explore these questions by conducting a survey experiment with a national

sample of 3,640 municipal officials in 2014. We present these elected officials with a

vignette about party recruitment for a state legislative seat in which the sex of the recruit

is randomly assigned. This allows us to compare whether respondents believe identical

male and female recruits are treated similarly by party leaders. We ask the respondents

how likely the party leader would be to give the recruit three types of valuable informal

support: 1) help with campaign strategy, 2) help with fundraising, and 3) help with

securing endorsements. We then analyze how male and female respondents answered

these questions so that we can identify their perceptions about how much elite support

recruits are likely to get. Conducting this experiment with a sample of municipal

officials is especially valuable because they represent a pool of potential candidates for

higher office who are likely to be targets for recruitment.

        Male and female respondents share the same overall sense of how much party

leaders generally help their recruits throughout the course of the campaign. However, the

female respondents in our sample reveal that they believe that this help usually goes

disproportionately to male recruits. The male respondents do not perceive there to be

gender disparities in the extent of support implied by recruitment. These findings suggest




                                                                                                2
that women and men interpret party efforts at recruitment quite differently. As a group,

men are more likely than women to believe that recruitment by party elites signals a

willingness to provide behind-the-scenes support for candidates like them. It is not

surprising, then, that men tend to respond to recruitment with more enthusiasm than

women. On a practical level, this means that party leaders who seek to recruit more

women to run for office may need to be quite explicit about the ongoing support they will

provide these recruits during the campaign process. If not, women are likely to see

recruitment as an empty request when targeted at people like them.



Recruitment and Candidate Emergence



        Although the conventional wisdom paints American politicians as ambitious

office-seekers, most candidates are not “self-starters.” Party recruitment plays a

significant role in shaping who runs for office in the United States (Broockman 2014;

Fox and Lawless 2010; Huckshorn and Spencer 1971; Kazee and Thornberry 1990;

Maestas et al. 2006; Maestas, Maisel, and Stone 2005; Moncrief, Squire, and Jewell

2001; Sanbonmatsu, Carroll, and Walsh 2009). For example, in a survey of first-time

state legislators, Moncrief et al find only about a third of these officials are self-starters

(Moncrief, Squire, and Jewell 2001). Carroll and Sanbonmatsu probe this question more

deeply and find that the rate of “self-starting” is different by gender, as well as by party.

Among male state legislators, 39% report that it was entirely their idea to run for office;

that number is only 22% for female state legislators. In fact, more than half of female

legislators “had not seriously thought about running until someone suggested it” (Carroll




                                                                                                 3
and Sanbonmatsu 2013a). Thus, while recruitment plays a role in most candidates’

decision to run for office, it appears to be especially important for women.

       However, women are significantly less likely to be recruited by political elites

than men (Crowder-Meyer 2011, 2013; Fox and Lawless 2010; Lawless and Fox 2010;

Niven 1998b; Sanbonmatsu 2006b). Research suggests that there are two primary

reasons for this. First, party elites tend to believe that ideal candidates have

characteristics similar to their own, including personality traits and occupation (Niven

1998b). Because most party elites are men, prospective female candidates are less likely

to seem ideal than prospective male candidates. Second, recruitment works through

networks, and political and personal networks tend to be gendered (Crowder-Meyer

2013). Among the most common sources that party elites look to for prospective

candidates are party member and officeholder networks, lower-level office-holders, and

among affiliated business organizations (397). Because women are generally

underrepresented among these networks, they are less likely to get recruited.

       Even when women are recruited, it’s not clear that they respond as positively as

men. Fox and Lawless find no differences in political ambition between elite,

professional men and women who recall being recruited by political operatives (Fox and

Lawless 2010). However, in interviews, political recruiters regularly insist that women

are more difficult to recruit than men (Sanbonmatsu 2006b). One noted that “one of the

most difficult things is convincing women to run or getting women to run….I think that’s

the biggest stumbling block to get over” (126). Recent scholarly research supports this

claim: equal recruitment of men and women does not lead to equal outcomes. In both a

large field study of male and female responses to actual party recruitment and in an exit




                                                                                            4
poll survey experiment, women were less responsive to recruitment than men, especially

Republican women (Preece and Stoddard 2015). Hence, because women are harder to

recruit, even more equitable recruitment of men and women is unlikely to solve the

gender gap in representation.



Gendered Perceptions of Recruitment Signals

       There has been very little research that directly addresses why women might be

less likely to respond positively to recruitment, though there is a great deal of related

literature. The literature on election aversion offers one plausible explanation (Kanthak

and Woon 2015; Preece and Stoddard 2015)—women may find the competition of

campaigns so distasteful that it requires much more to convince them to run. The

literatures on family obligations (Fulton et al. 2006; Sapiro 1982; Silbermann 2015) and

beliefs about qualifications (Lawless and Fox 2010) provide other explanations for why

women might demur. All of these explanations suggest rich avenues for exploring how

recruitment interacts with the social, structural, and psychological constraints that women

disproportionally face.

       In this paper, we choose to focus on one specific mechanism: perceptions about

the support that recruiters will provide candidates like them during the campaign. The

existing literature on recruitment has focused on attempts to recruit (who recruits, who

they recruit, how they recruit, etc.). But, recruitment is an interactive process, and it is

important to think about how recruits perceive and interpret recruitment efforts. This

may be especially important for understanding women’s reactions to recruitment because,

as Carroll and Sanbonmatsu point out, “women’s decision making about office holding is




                                                                                               5
more likely to be influenced by the beliefs and reactions, both real and perceived, of other

people” (Carroll and Sanbonmatsu 2013a, 45). For these reasons, we focus on what

recruitment implies to individuals who are recruited.

       We propose that one reason women are systematically less responsive to

recruitment is that they perceive recruitment signals differently than men do. On its face,

recruitment is simply a request that an individual consider running for office. But, many

recruits also reasonably interpret recruitment as a signal of support and promise of

informal help throughout the campaign. Interpretations of that signal are probably

particularly important in the American context. In more party-dominated systems, party

leaders control ballot access—so party recruitment is a clear, credible signal of support

(Carey and Shugart 1995; Rahat and Hazan 2001). In the United States, however, party

leaders generally have no direct control over whose name appears on the ballot. Instead,

party leaders have social and political capital that they can expend on behalf of

candidates they support: endorsements, introductions to donors, access to party money,

campaign advice, etc.

       Research on endorsements, extended party networks, and the “invisible primary”

suggests that this kind of informal, behind-the-scenes elite support plays a significant role

in candidate success (Cohen et al. 2008; Desmarais, La Raja, and Kowal 2015;

Dominguez 2011; Hassell 2015; Kousser et al. 2015; Masket 2009). Elite support can

clearly be very valuable, but the extent to which the recruiter can or will provide these

optional resources to the recruit is often ambiguous and open to interpretation. Running

for office is a costly endeavor, so assumptions about the level of support one can get from

political insiders are important. Someone who believes that a recruiter will go to great




                                                                                            6
lengths to facilitate a recruit’s success is more likely to seriously consider running than

someone who does not.

       Men might be more likely than women to believe recruitment implies continued

support for candidates like them for several reasons. Women are at the periphery of most

professional and political networks (Crowder-Meyer 2013). While the stereotypical “old

boys network” that actively excludes women may be less common than it used to be,

there is significant evidence that homophilous interactions continue to exist in the

workforce and in politics (McDonald 2011; McPherson, Smith-Lovin, and Cook 2001;

Sanbonmatsu 2006b).

        This leads to two potential mechanisms through which women may doubt that

party elites will invest in recruits like them: 1) a mechanism that works through

knowledge diffusion and 2) a mechanism that works through experiences of bias. First,

women’s position at the periphery of professional and political networks may mean that

they are simply less familiar with the extent to which party leaders support candidates

and the ways in which this happens. They may not expect recruiters to provide much

informal help and support to any of their recruits, assuming that all candidates are more

or less on their own as they campaign in an ostensibly candidate-centered system.

Fundamentally, this is an artifact of the way in which information diffuses through

networks. Those at the periphery of social networks generally have less knowledge about

the norms of the network (Granovetter 2005). They also have more trouble learning from

the relationships they do have in the network (Borgatti and Cross 2003). If this

mechanism is at play, we would expect to see that women have overall lower

expectations of party elite involvement because they are unfamiliar with the ways in




                                                                                              7
which party leaders help recruits. In other words, female respondents’ estimates about

how much elite help the average candidate is likely to get will be lower than men’s.

       Second, women may be as aware as men of the potential benefits that can come

from party support during the invisible primary and beyond; however, they may be

skeptical that those benefits are likely to accrue to women. This mechanism comes

through experience with bias. Women’s prior experience at the periphery of political and

professional networks may reveal to them that although political elites do expend extra

social and political capital on some recruits’ behalf, those fortunate recruits tend to be

men. They understand that the “old boys network” can be very helpful, but they doubt it

will go out of its way to invest in them (Sanbonmatsu 2006b). Indeed, there has been

some research that suggests that party elites do bring gendered assumptions to the table

when they consider who to support (Bos 2015; Niven 1998a). Sanbonmatsu finds that

party leader perceptions of female candidates’ viability are not systematically correlated

with female candidates’ vote share and success rates in their state (Sanbonmatsu 2006a).

And Sharrow et al find that national party convention delegates evaluated female

candidates in their respective parties based on their personal attitudes about women’s

roles (Sharrow et al. Forthcoming). If this mechanism is at play, we should see women

expecting that more elite support will go to male recruits than female recruits. These two

mechanisms are not mutually exclusive—women may believe political elites are less

involved in supporting candidates overall and especially less involved in supporting

women.



Measuring Potential Recruits’ Perceptions




                                                                                             8
        To measure men and women’s perceptions about what kind of informal party

help might come along with recruitment, we designed a survey experiment that was

fielded to several thousand municipal officials across the United States. When party

leaders consider whom to recruit to run for office, individuals in these lower-level

positions represent a great resource. Because they are already serving in public office,

party leaders know that these individuals are willing to serve. Further, they typically

have some electoral experience (indeed, successful electoral experience). Party leaders

also more likely to have had past experience with these individuals. For party leaders

who recruit candidates to run for the state legislature, elected city officials (mayors and

councilors) represent a strong pool of potential candidates. Indeed, survey evidence

suggests that party leaders often turn to this group to recruit candidates. In a recent

survey of county party chairs, Crowder-Meyer found that two-thirds of county party

chairs from both parties look for candidates among sub-county office holders (2013,

397). This group is targeted for recruitment more than any other. Hence, we believe they

are an ideal subject pool for the question of how political recruits perceive invitations

from party leaders to run for a seat in the lower-chamber of their state legislature.

       Because we are interested in measuring these officials’ perceptions, we created a

vignette experiment that was included as part of a survey sent to a national sample of

elected officials during the summer of 2014. The sample of city officials for the survey

was constructed by first downloading a list of all of the cities in the U.S. Census with a

population of 3,000 or more. Research assistants were then hired in the spring of 2014 to

search for the website of each town or city taken from the census. If the research




                                                                                              9
assistants were able to identify the city’s website, they then collected the name and email

address of the city’s mayor and council members (or the equivalent). This search yielded

29,136 officials. We invited these officials to take our survey by sending them an email

(the text of the invitation is given in the supplementary materials).

       Overall, we had a response rate of 18 percent, 1 on par with recent expert surveys

of this nature (e.g., Fisher and Herrick 2013; Harden 2013). The respondents come from

across the United States with more populous states representing a larger portion of the

sample (see Figure 2 in the Supplementary Materials). Early in the survey respondents

were asked several demographic questions, including their gender and self-identified

partisanship. Because we are interested in how politicians perceive the recruitment efforts

of their party leaders, we only focus on the city officials who self-identified with either

the Republican or Democratic Party. 2 Partisanship was the only screen used to exclude

respondents from the sample for analysis (e.g., no attention checks or other criteria were

used). Table 1 gives information about the public officials in our sample, broken down

by gender.

                                 INSERT TABLE 1 HERE

       Our sample includes nearly an equal number of Republicans and Democrats

(Republicans make up 51 percent of the sample). It also has good gender representation,

with about 1,100 female officials (roughly 30 percent of the sample). As is observed at

other levels of government, the majority of women in the sample are Democrats.



1
 5,370 took at least part of the survey.
2
 The majority of cities use non-partisan elections to elect municipal officials and many
of the officials from those cities self-identify as being independent. We replicated the
analysis with respondents who identified as independents, and the results were
substantively similar.


                                                                                              10
However, the sample has a large number of female respondents from both parties, with

nearly 40 percent of the women in the sample self-identifying as Republican.

       The women in the sample are slightly less likely to be serving as elected

executives. While approximately 20 percent of the men in the sample are mayors (or the

equivalent), only 15 percent of the women are. The rest of the sample serve as city

councilors or the equivalent. The women in the sample do come from cities that are

slightly larger on average. Women come from cities with an average population of

42,000 (and a median of 18,000), while men come from cities with an average population

of 36,000 (and a median of 15,000). As a robustness check, we control for these

variables in the analysis.

       The advantage of studying this sample is that we have a chance to go beyond

typical student convenience samples in order to learn directly from public officials (Kam,

Wilking, and Zechmeister 2007). Because of their background and experience, public

officials may simply react differently than others would (Butler and Kousser 2015). In

this particular case, it might actually be harder to find any differences in anticipated

support between men and women because all of the officials in our sample are

individuals who have been successful in holding office. As a result, the men and women

in our sample may have experienced greater levels of equality in terms of party support

than those who do not make it into office. Among the broader recruitment pool (see

Lawless and Fox 2010), there may be larger differences in men’s and women’s

perceptions of recruitment. And of course, the experimental approach allows us to

maximize internal validity in the experiment.




                                                                                           11
       We presented the officials in our sample with the vignette experiment shown in

Box 1. The vignette focuses on the situation of a party leader recruiting a candidate to run

for a seat in the state legislature. For our experiment we varied the bolded items in

brackets. Each of the bolded items was randomly assigned independently of one another.

Qualtrics performed the randomization as part of the survey, with each of the treatments

for each item having equal probability of being assigned to each participant.

Box 1. Vignette Design
Think of the party label you would run under if you sought a seat in the state legislature.
Imagine that the state party chair for your party was evaluating whether to recruit the
following individual to [run for an open state legislative seat / challenge an
incumbent state legislator from the opposing party].

Name: [Andrew/Thomas/Michael/Richard / Karen/Laura/Heather/Christine] Wilson
Age: 44
Family Situation: Married, [no children / 3 children (ages 16, 12, and 9)]
Professional Background: Real Estate Agent
Political Experience: [None / 4 years as a county party chair]
After some consideration, the state party chair decides to make a personal appeal to
[NAME] to run for the state legislative seat. How likely are the following?

{Options on 5-point scale: Extremely Likely/Somewhat Likely/ Neither likely nor
unlikely / Somewhat Unlikely/Extremely Unlikely}
--The party chair will meet with [NAME] to discuss campaign strategy
--The party chair will introduce [NAME] to prominent campaign donors and encourage
his/her executive board to invest extra party campaign funds into [NAME]’s race
--The party chair will help [NAME] get meetings with prominent politicians (governor,
Member of Congress, etc.) to secure their endorsement


       As Box 1 shows, we varied four aspects of the vignette—the implied sex of the

candidate, plus three other candidate characteristics. We varied the first name of the

potential recruit in order to measure whether respondents thought leaders would support

male and female recruits differently. 3 Because we varied all of the aspects of the


3
 We used more than one name to mitigate any possible concern that the results are driven
by the idiosyncratic nature of reactions to a specific name.


                                                                                          12
description independently, varying the putative sex of the candidate (via variation of their

name) allows us to see how respondents believe the party leaders will treat otherwise

comparable male and female candidates. Essentially, this allows us to ask respondents

how they believe people like them will be treated by party leaders after they are recruited.

Although it would have been interesting to ask the officials about whether party recruiters

would be likely to provide various types of support to them personally if they were

recruited, this would shift the project away from an experimental study in which the male

and female recruits in the vignette are otherwise identical. We believe that the gains to

internal validity were worth the abstraction of the vignette.

       We also varied whether the party leaders were recruiting the candidate to run for

an open state legislative seat or to challenge an incumbent state legislator from the

opposing party; whether the candidate had children; and the recruit’s political experience.

Although we had some informal expectations about the effect of these profile variations

on the dependent variables, we primarily varied them to see how robust our main findings

would be and to provide context and points of comparison. Informally, we expected

respondents to believe that party leaders would provide more support for candidates who

fit the profile of those likely to win: those running for an open seat (Mayhew 1974;

Gelman and King 1990); candidates without children at home—especially among women

(Carroll and Sanbonmatsu 2013a; Lawless and Fox 2010); and more politically

experienced candidates (Cox and Katz 1996).

       We finished the vignette by having respondents state, on a five-point scale, how

likely the state party chair would be to support the hypothetical candidate in three

different activities: campaign strategy, fundraising, and networking (See Box 1). These




                                                                                            13
activities represent ways in which a party chair has discretion in expending additional

political and social capital to support a candidate, and they were selected after we talked

with an experienced party chair about the dynamics of informal elite support.

Essentially, they are measures of how much mentoring party leaders are likely to provide

to those they recruit to run for office.

        First, we asked respondents how likely the party chair would be to meet the

candidate in the vignette and discuss campaign strategy. This is a form of optional,

private, personal investment that requires a chair’s valuable time. Even if a party leader

publicly supports a candidate, he or she may not take the time to personally mentor him

or her. Second, we asked about how likely the chair would be to encourage prominent

campaign donors (including those who control the party coffers) to support the candidate.

Donor support is important for candidates, but party leaders are likely to selectively

introduce and recommend candidates to donors because doing so takes time and uses

political capital. Third, we asked how likely the party leader would be to help set up

meetings with prominent politicians to secure their endorsements. Endorsements matter

(Cohen et al. 2008; Dominguez 2011), but again, facilitating them requires the time and

political capital of party leaders. Busy party leaders could plausibly decline—or simply

ignore—a candidate’s request for help with networking.

        For the analysis we used factor analysis to create a summary support scale. The

factor loadings for the three measures of support are all high (in this case all greater than

0.9). Further, the first dimension predicts 85 percent of the variation in the three outcome

variables. In the main body of the paper we present the results using this summary

support scale as the dependent variable. We present the results when using the three

the supplementary materials. For the analysis we also present the results both without

any control variables and when controlling for several variables suggested by reviewers:

whether the city officials was a mayor (as opposed to a councilor), the population of the

city, the official’s partisanship, and state fixed effects.



Results

        We are interested in understanding whether there are differences in men’s and

women’s perceptions of what implicit promises of support accompany recruitment.

Differences could come from two sources: women systematically believe that recruitment

implies less help for everyone (the information diffusion mechanism), or women

systematically believe that recruitment implies less help for female recruits than male

recruits (the experience with bias mechanism).

        Table 2 clearly shows that the information diffusion mechanism is not at play. It

presents the regression results in which we ignore all of the randomized treatments and

simply regress the measures of likely leader support on the gender of the respondent. The

coefficient on the gender of the respondent is substantively and statistically insignificant.

Women and men do not differ in how much they think leaders support their recruits on

average. This suggests that it is not the case that women’s experience on the periphery of

political networks has influenced their perceptions of the overall amount of help from

political elites that is available to recruits.



                                   INSERT TABLE 2 HERE




                                                                                            15
       The results in Table 2 present the average across all of the candidate profiles that

the respondents see. So, they do not tell us anything about whether respondents believe

this help is equally available to male and female candidates—the experience with bias

mechanism. To test this, we turn to the experimental conditions, which allow us to

measure female and male respondents’ perceptions about the help that identical

hypothetical female and male recruits are likely to get from party leaders.

Female Respondents:

       We are able to examine women’s perceptions of the impact of the sex of the

recruit on elite support by estimating regression models that include dummy variables for

the candidate characteristics we randomized in the vignette (see Box 1). Columns 1 and

2 of Table 3 present the results for what predicts female officials’ perceptions of leader

support. Column 1 presents the results of the direct effect of candidate sex in order to see

respondents’ perceptions about the differences between men and women, all else equal.

In Column 2 we add interactions between the sex of the recruit and the other

characteristics we varied to see if respondents believed that some circumstances moderate

the level of support that women receive from party leaders.



                                 INSERT TABLE 3 HERE



       As Column 1 shows, female respondents perceive that party leaders may make

marginally less effort if the recruit is a women, all else equal; however, the result does

not achieve statistical significance. Column 2, which includes a fuller model with




                                                                                             16
interaction terms, reveals why this coefficient is not significant: women with different

characteristics are expected to be treated differently, and these differences partly cancel

each other out in the aggregate. The coefficient on the dummy variable female recruit in

Column 2 gives the perceived difference for how men and women in the baseline

category are treated. In this case, the baseline category is an inexperienced challenger

with no children. Under these circumstances, the coefficient for whether the recruit is a

woman is large—about third of a point on a 5-point scale —and negative and statistically

significant. These women are expected to receive much less help from party recruiters

than men.

        The major exception to this perception of gender bias regards women with

children. There is a positive coefficient on the interaction term with children, suggesting

that women believe that officials will be less likely to make hollow requests to women

with children. This is not what we expected a priori, but one possible explanation for this

pattern is that women believe party leaders are sensitive to familial obligations. Running

a campaign is hard on a family. These results are consistent with the possibility that

women believe leaders to be aware of these difficulties, so only ask women to run if they

are committed to truly supporting their candidacy. None of the other characteristics we

experimentally manipulated—political experience or running in an open seat—seem to

counterbalance the overall perceived bias against women.

        In short, the results suggest that although female respondents are equally likely to

believe that party elites help recruits overall, they do not believe party elites will help the

women they recruit to the same extent as they help the men they recruit. The size of this

difference is quite large. The only exception is that women expect that female recruits




                                                                                              17
with children will be supported as much as male recruits. Since most women in the

traditional candidate eligibility pool (Lawless and Fox 2010, 73) and in state legislative

office (Carroll and Sanbonmatsu 2013, 33) do not have children at home, this may be

cold comfort. Without being directly asked about it, female respondents reveal that they

believe party officials will behave in biased ways, even after making ostensibly

equivalent recruitment efforts.

       Male Respondents: Columns 3 and 4 of Table 3 present corresponding

regressions analyzing the perceptions of the male respondents in our sample. The men do

not believe that party leaders will treat recruits differently based on their gender. Instead,

the men in our sample believe that officials treat candidates differently based almost

solely on their level of experience. They believe that recruits who have served as the

county chair for the past four years will receive much more support than recruits who

have no political experience. It is worth noting, however, that the magnitude of the

difference between experienced and inexperienced recruits that men report is smaller than

the magnitude that women report between (most) male and female recruits.

       On the one hand, male respondents’ belief that male and female recruits will be

treated equitably could be seen as an unwillingness to admit that men have advantages in

political networks. However, because no respondent saw both male and female profiles,

they were not primed to make gender comparisons. They spontaneously evaluated these

candidates as equally capable of getting support from party elites. In other words, male

respondents revealed that they judged these male and female recruits as more or less

interchangeable. Further, they did not believe that, for example, experience was more

important for women than for men. This may be an encouraging finding that suggests




                                                                                             18
that male municipal officials are generally capable of fairly judging the quality of a

recruit.



Conclusion

           Most of the literature on political recruitment has focused on recruitment from an

elite perspective: who recruits, who they recruit, how they recruit, how frequently they

recruit, etc. Scholars have rightly identified gender gaps in who gets recruited as an

important contribution to the gender gap in political representation. Women are less

likely to be recruited, and this is especially problematic because they are also

significantly less likely to “self-start” than men. But recruitment is an interactive

process, and so we assert that it is also important to look at recruitment from the

perspective of those who are recruited.

           Previous research suggests that women are less responsive to recruitment than

men, and our results provide one explanation for why. Male and female respondents in

our survey experiment have similar beliefs about the average amount of help with

fundraising, endorsements, and campaign advice that party leaders generally give to their

recruits over the course of the campaign. In other words, women are not naïve to the role

that elites play in the behind-the-scenes political process to facilitate recruits’ success.

Our sample consists of male and female elected officials who are likely to be quite

familiar with the political process, though, so this result may not be particularly

surprising in retrospect. That does not mean, however, that this mechanism might not be

at play for recruits without prior political experience. If the experiment was replicated




                                                                                               19
with a pool of qualified but less politically experienced individuals (such as the sample in

Lawless and Fox 2010), we might see different results.

       Nevertheless, female respondents (but not male respondents) do believe that

recruiters are generally more likely to give that support to male recruits than to female

recruits. The only mitigating factor seems to be if the female candidate has children.

From a substantive perspective, this is not necessarily encouraging because women in the

candidate edibility pool are much less likely than men to have children, especially young

children (Lawless and Fox 2010, 73). In fact, Carroll and Sanbonmatsu find that only

about 14% of women in the state legislature have children under 18 (Carroll and

Sanbonmatsu 2013, 33). Hence, female respondents would predict that the vast majority

of women that are being recruited to the state legislature (the recruitment scenario in our

experiment) would experience significant bias.

       In colloquial terms, female respondents believe that the “old boys network” is still

relevant when it comes to the kinds of support that recruits will get over the course of the

campaign. This is consistent with Sanbonmatsu’s elite interviews with female elected

officials. They felt like “women were much less likely to be groomed and mentored than

men” and that men were much more frequently seen as “golden boys” than women

(Sanbonmatsu 2006b, 136). Respondents repeatedly pointed to their experiences with

gendered political networks to reinforce this claim.

       Hence, we argue that skepticism about the amount of practical mentorship that

will come with recruitment likely contributes to women’s more hesitant responses to

recruitment attempts by political elites. If women believe the likelihood of continued

informal elite support is lower for candidates like them, recruitment seems less




                                                                                            20
meaningful in a costly and taxing electoral environment. It is not surprising, then, that

they respond less enthusiastically than the men who don’t see their sex as an impediment

to getting practical party support.

       These findings suggest that political elites who are interested in encouraging more

women to run for office should not assume that female recruits believe a request to run

for office comes with an implicit promise of concrete support. It may be necessary to be

explicit about the ways in which they are willing to use their political and social capital to

help the recruit be successful. Without considering this difference in perception, even

more gender-balanced recruiting methods are unlikely to close the gender gap in political

representation.
