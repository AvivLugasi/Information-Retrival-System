Does Gender Bias Influence

AGU is a participant in a U.S. National
Science Foundation (NSF)–funded project
called Advancing Ways of Awarding Recog-
nition in Disciplinary Societies (AWARDS),
which seeks to examine whether gender
bias affects selection of recipients of society
awards. AGU is interested in learning why
there is a higher proportion of female recipi-
ents of service and education awards over
the past 2 decades. Combined with a lower
rate of receipt of research awards, these
results suggest that implicit (subconscious)
bias in favor of male candidates still influ-
ences awardee selection.

Six other professional societies (American
Chemical Society, American Mathematical
Society, American Society of Anesthesiolo-
gists, Mathematical Association of Amer-
ica, Society for Neuroscience, and Society
for Industrial and Applied Mathematics)

are participating in the project. Volunteers
from each participant society attended an
Association for Women in Science (AWIS)–
sponsored workshop in May 2010 to exam-
ine  data and review literature on best prac-
tices for fair selection of society awardees. A
draft proposal for implementing these prac-
tices will be brought before the AGU Council
and the Honors and Recognition Committee
at their upcoming meetings.

While the data are interesting, their impli-
cations are manifold. Not only can this study
help AGU leadership ensure that awards are
given in a manner that does not subcon-
sciously favor one gender over the other, but
also results can guide AGU members who
nominate candidates for awards. Further,
AGU members involved with the leadership of
their institutions or of other societies may find
results useful for averting bias in their own
award selections. Collecting the data is the
first step in determining whether bias exists.

The Data: Categories of Awards
With Recipients by Gender

these awards appears low. But medals and
Fellow status are generally conferred upon
more senior scientists. During this decade,
women composed 5–9% of full professors
at research-intensive universities (Figure 1).
Compared to full professors, 11% is about
right, if not on the high side.

There is a higher proportion of women
recipients of early-career awards: 18% from
1991 to 2001 and 27% from 2001 to 2010
(Table 1). By contrast, women made up
25–36% of Ph.D.s and 24%–30% of post-
docs from 2001 to 2010 [NSF, 2011a, 2011b].
Compared to the values of the later years
of  those decades, the numbers of awards
appear to be low.

Women received a higher proportion of
service and education awards: 22% from
1991  to 2010 (Table 1). The twofold differ-
ence between receipt of scholarly awards by
senior scientists versus service and teaching
awards is not unique to AGU; every scientific
society in the AWARDS study had twice as
many women receiving awards for service,
teaching, mentoring, and communication as
those receiving awards that recognize senior
scholarship and research.

Implications

Where does bias exist: in those who nomi-
nate candidates for awards or in how award-
ees are selected? Data on the numbers and
gender of people nominated for awards are
lacking—these data were simply not col-
lected    prior to AGU’s participation in this
study. In 2010, when the data began to be col-
lected, a total of four women were nominated
for two of the seven medals awarded that
year that went to senior scientists. On aver-
age, five people were nominated for each of
these awards, and 7% of the nominees were
women. Women made up 20% of the nomi-
nees  for one early-career medal; a woman

awards suggests that geoscientists overlook
their female colleagues when it comes to
nominating their peers for disciplinary awards
but  are ready to nominate women for the
roles that traditional stereotypes hold as more
applicable to women: service and education.

The difference between service and edu-
cation awards and research awards sug-
gests that unintended associations (implicit
biases) may be influencing awardee selec-
tion. These arise from subconscious efforts
to simplify sensory inputs by creating men-
tal shortcuts. An example of a mental short-
cut is “cloning,” replicating oneself by hir-
ing or, in this case, nominating and posi-
tively evaluating, someone with attributes or
background similar to one’s own. Another is
“snap judgments,” making decisions based
on one or two lines of evidence rather than
on the entire dossier, such as “he went to
my alma mater, so he must be good” or

“he worked with my advisor/colleague/
coauthor,” and then ignoring or downplay-
ing  the rest of the dossier (see J. Moody,
“Rising above cognitive errors: Guidelines
to improve faculty searches, evaluations,
and decision-making,” 2010, at http://www

.diversityoncampus.com/id13.html).

The impact of such mental shortcuts is
demonstrated in the literature on implicit
bias. For example, in a recent study, both
men and women evaluators were presented
with identical curriculum vitae, except for
the first name—one third had recognizably
female names, one third had male names,
and one third had initials instead of given
names; most preferred the male candidates
[Steinpreis et al., 1999], suggesting that men
subconsciously fit a typical snapshot men-
tal image of the appropriate person for the
job. Both men and women also tend to
write letters of recommendation differently
depending on the gender of the candidate:
letters written for women tend to be shorter


There are eight AGU medals awarded to
senior scientists (e.g., the Harry Hess, Inge
Lehmann, and William Bowie medals), each of
which has one awardee per year. There were
no women recipients of any of these med-

als from 1991 to 2000; there were eight (11%)

from 2001 to 2010 (Table 1). Ten percent of

Fellows from 1997 to 2000 were women; 11% of
Fellows from 2001 to 2010 were women (Fig-
ure 1). Fellow status is awarded when a senior
AGU member receives a medal, if he or she is
not already a Fellow.

Are these numbers high or low? The
answer depends on the comparison popula-
tion. Women were 15–20% of AGU member-
ship from 1999 to 2010. Compared to mem-
bership, the proportion of women receiving

recipients.

fessional traits [e.g., Trix and Psenka, 2003].
The bias that makes us think of professional
traits in male candidates and personal

traits in female candidates makes letters for
women weaker and women therefore less
appealing as candidates.

AWARDS Recommendations

Webcasts summarizing research on implicit
bias and strategies on how to minimize its
impact are now available to AGU members,
and members of awards selection committees
are strongly encouraged to view them (see

Strategies to reduce the impact of implicit
bias or associations on candidate evaluation
include the following:

aData are grouped by decade to make more meaningful the small numbers of awards 
given annually.

bFor 1997–2000 only (1991–1996 data not found).

cIncludes section and focus group awards.


• Provide checklists and structured eval-
uation forms for nominators (rubrics)

instead of letters of nomination, which
tend to be subjective and may be
gender-biased. Criteria should focus on
accomplishments.

• Create a clear set of criteria for the
most worthy awardee before commit-

tees meet.

• Empower the Honors and Recogni-
tion Committee with broad oversight of

award committees.

• Provide the committee members with
a history of the award’s nominees and

winners broken down by gender and
race (where possible).

• Recognize the impact of implicit bias
and discuss it with all committee mem-

bers before discussing applicants.

• Increase the number of women nomi-
nated for society awards. In 2010, women

received 2 of 19 awards and medals. Of
163 nominees, 33 were women. Most of
these nominations (23) were for service
and education awards; only four were for
senior-level awards and medals. The rest
were  for early-career awards.

Ellen Druffel examined gender distribution
among AGU Fellows in an article published
in  Eos about 2 decades ago [Druffel, 1994].
Her findings and recommendations ring true
even now. She urged AGU members to nomi-
nate worthy women, use genderless language
for the nomination process, have AGU priori-
tize gender equity in awards, and increase
the numbers and visibility of women in AGU.
Today, with enhanced understanding of the
evaluation process and new data, it is hoped
that  the next decade will see substantive
progress toward rewarding women for their
accomplishments in Earth science research
in  accordance with their representation in dif-
ferent career stages.
