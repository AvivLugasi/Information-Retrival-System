Abstract
This paper conducts an econometric analysis of data for a sample of over
4000 children in India, between the ages of 1-2 years of age, with a view to
studying two aspects of the neglect of children: their likelihood of being
immunised against disease and their likelihood of receiving a nutritious diet.
The starting hypothesis, consistent with an universal interest in gender issues,
was that girls were more likely to be neglected than boys. The analysis
confirmed this hypothesis. In respect of vaccinations, the likelihood of girls
being fully vaccinated, after controlling for other variables, was five
percentage points lower than that for boys. In respect of receiving a nutritious
diet, the treatment of girls depended very much on whether or not their
mothers were literate: there was no gender discrimination between children of
literate mothers; on the other hand, when the mother was illiterate, girls were
five percentage points less likely to be well-fed relative to their brothers and
the presence of a literate father did little to dent this gender gap. But the
analysis also pointed to a broader conclusion which was that all children in
India suffered from sharper, but less publicised, forms of disadvantage than
that engendered solely by gender. These were the consequences which
stemmed from children being born to illiterate mothers and being brought up
in the more impoverished parts of India.

Introduction
A feature of developing countries that is particularly worrying is the adverse
ratio of the number of women to that of men. Even though males outnumber
females at birth (and even more at conception) women tend to outnumber
men in North America and Europe with an average ratio of 1.05. By contrast,
the female-male ratio is substantially below unity in many countries of the third
world: 0.96 in North Africa; 0.94 in China, Bangladesh and West Asia; 0.93 in
India; 0.91 in Pakistan. Dreze and Sen (1996), who present these figures,
have termed these low female-male ratios as a “missing women”
phenomenon: on the basis of European ratios, the number of “missing
women” in Asia and North Africa is between 60-90 million (Coale, 1991;
Klasen, 1994).
In broad terms, the problem of “missing women” stems from the unequal
treatment of women. This could take the form of “natal inequality” where the
preference for sons, in conjunction with modern techniques to determine the
gender of the foetus, results in sex-selective abortions. This type of inequality
is particularly prevalent in countries of East and South Asia (Sen, 2001). It
could also take the form of “mortality inequality” whereby there is, relative to
boys and men, a general neglect of girls and women in respect of factors that
contribute to physical well-being: for example, girls and women could be
relatively deprived in terms of their diet and in terms of their access to, and
utilisation of, health care facilities. Natal inequality and mortality inequality
then combine to ensure that there are fewer women than men in countries
where such forms of gender discrimination are particularly marked (Kishor,
1993, 1994).
Against this background, this paper exploits information from a rich set of data
for India to examine and to quantify two important aspects of the relative
neglect of girls. The first is the degree to which girls between the ages of one
and two years (inclusive), relative to boys of the same age, were „fully
immunised‟ (defined below) against: tuberculosis (by means of a Bacille
Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccination); polio; diptheria-pertussis-tetanus (DPT);

1

and measles. The second aspect (of the neglect of girls) is the extent to
which, relative to boys, they received a „nutritious‟ diet (defined below).
In this context, this paper attempts an econometric investigation of:
(i)

the likelihood of a child, between the ages of 1-2 years, being fully
immunised and

(ii)

of the likelihood of it receiving a nutritious diet.

As the title of paper suggests, the sex of the child is hypothesised to be a
significant determinant of both probabilities. Underlying any gender bias in
the likelihood of full immunisation and of a nutritional diet is the literacy status
of the mother and/or the father of the child. This paper asks whether the
relative neglect of girls can be blunted, if not eliminated, by parental literacy.
It is important to ask this question because a recurring theme in the literature
on the welfare of children in developing countries is the importance of having
literate parents and, in particular, of having a literate mother. There is a body
of evidence to suggest that the number of children born to a woman is
inversely related to her level of education (Borooah, 2000; Parikh and Gupta,
2001; Borooah, 2002). Furthermore, there is considerable evidence to
suggest that children's health (including the likelihood of their surviving infancy
and childhood), nutritional status and educational attainments are enhanced
by having better educated parents, particularly the mother (Behrman and
Wolfe, 1984; Thomas, Strauss and Henriques, 1991; Sandiford, Cassel,
Montenegro and Sanchez, 1995; Lavy, Strauss, Thomas and de Vreyer,
1996; Ravallion and Wodon, 2000; Gibson, 2001). Evidence also suggests
that a farm-household's total income depends upon the highest education
level reached by a household member rather than by the mean educational
level of the household or by the educational level of the household head
(Foster and Rosensweig, 1996). To add to this litany, education also raises
the wages of both men and women (Kingdon and Unni, 2001).
Augmenting the theme of the benefits of literacy, is another, more recent,
issue relating to the nature of literacy. This argues that some of the
2

disadvantages to a person of being illiterate may be mitigated if he/she lives in
a household in which other members are literate since, for many activities,
having access to the ability of the literate members to read and write may
serve as a form of 'surrogate' or 'proximate' literacy. In that sense, an
illiterate person living with a literate person(s) may not, by virtue of his/her
illiteracy, be so badly off as an illiterate person living in a household in which
all are illiterate since, in the former situation, he/she is 'proximate literate'
while in the latter situation, he/she is illiterate (Basu and Foster, 1998; Basu,
Narayan and Ravallion, 2002).
In order to take account of this aspect of literacy the children in this study
were distinguished according as to whether their mothers were:
(i)

literate;

(ii)

proximate literate, that is mother illiterate but father literate;

(iii)

illiterate, that is mother and father illiterate

and an important feature of this study is an examination of whether gender
bias in the likelihood of being fully immunised and in the likelihood of receiving
a nutritious diet were different for these three different types of maternal
literacy/illiteracy.
The econometric estimates which underpin the analysis are based on unitrecord data for over 4,000 children, between the ages of 1-2 years
(inclusive), living in rural households drawn from the sixteen major states of
India. The features of the Survey which provided these data are described in
an Appendix to this paper. The data provided information on the vaccination
history of each child as well as details of the nature of the food ingested by
the child in the previous two days.
Using information on vaccination records, children between the ages of 1-2
years were said to be „fully immunised‟ if they had received: three DPT doses;
three polio doses; one BCG dose; and one measles dose. In terms of the diet
of the children, the survey focused on whether the child had received milk,
cereals and pulses, and green vegetables and/or fruit in the past two days.
Using this information, a child was defined to have received a „nutritious‟ diet
3

if, in the two days prior to survey questionnaire being administered, he/she
had been given all three of: milk; cereals and pulses; vegetables and/or fruit.
This information on vaccination and diet could then be related to inter alia: the
household circumstances of the children, with particular reference to the
region of India in which they resided; the circumstances of the mothers; the
quality of the relevant infra-structure available to the households in which the
children lived, with particular reference to the availability of health care
facilities and mother-and-child centres (known in India as anganwadis); the
occupations of the parents; and their caste and religion.

Econometric Specification
The binary variables, Ri and Si were defined as:
(a) Ri  1 if the child was fully immunised, in the sense of having received the
full complement of eight vaccination doses (as defined above), Ri  0 ,
otherwise
(b) Si  1 if the child received a „nutritious‟ diet (as defined above), Si  0 ,
otherwise
The probabilities of a child being fully immunised and of receiving a nutritious
diet were modelled, separately for boys and for girls, as logit models:

where: xik and zij are the values of the kth and the jth determining variables for
the ith child, in respectively, the vaccination and the diet equations for:
k=1…K, j=1…J, i=1…N. The vaccination and the diet equations were
estimated separately for boys (2,269 observations) and for girls (2,064
observations). Depending on the context, therefore, the  and the 
represent the coefficients for boys or for girls.

(1)

The vector of determining variables (see equation (1)) were specified, for
each child, in terms of the following variables:
(i)

Maternal Literacy Status: literate; proximate literate; illiterate1.

(ii)

Caste/Religion: Dalits2; Muslim; Hindu3.

(iii)

Household Assets.

The NCAER Survey offered two measures of

household assets: business assets (tractors; threshing machines etc.)
and consumption assets (television; motor car/cycle etc.). These
assets were then aggregated (using appropriate weights) to form a
business assets index and a consumption assets index.
(iv)

Household Income. The NCAER Survey gave the total annual income
of a household and also placed each household in the appropriate
income quintile.

(v)

Household Poverty. A household was classed as „poor‟ if its income
was below the poverty line income4.

(vi)

Female Empowerment. Women in a household were said to be
„empowered‟ if a female member of the household, at least 1-2 days
per week: read a newspaper; or listened to the radio; or watched
television.

(vii)

Region: the Survey contained information for each of sixteen states. In
this study, the states were aggregated to form five regions: the Centre
consisting of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh;
the South consisting of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil
Nadu; the West consisting of Maharashtra and Gujarat; the East
consisting of the North-Eastern region, Bengal and Orissa; and the
North consisting of Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab5.

(viii)

Parental Occupation. For fathers, the mutually exclusive and
collectively exhaustive occupational categories were:

1

Note that literacy, proximate literacy and illiteracy are collectively exhaustive with illiteracy
being the residual category

The Indian government has drawn up a list of castes and tribes entitled to reservation in
terms of parliamentary seats, public sector jobs and educational places. These castes/tribes
are synonymous with the „untouchable‟ castes of India and persons belonging to these
castes/tribes refer to themselves, and prefer others to refer to them, as „Dalits‟ (meaning
„oppressed‟). Nearly 90% of Dalits in the NCAER Survey gave their religion as „Hindu‟.
3
That is, non-Dalit Hindus (see footnote above). Note that the caste/religion categories are
collectively exhaustive with Hindus being the residual category.

(a) cultivator: if the man was (primarily) engaged in cultivation or allied
agricultural activities
(b) labourer: if the man was (primarily) a (agricultural or non-agricultural)
labourer, cattle tender or domestic servant
(c) non-manual worker
For women, in addition to (a)-(c) above, there was a fourth (residual)
category: „unoccupied‟.
(ix)

Village-level health care facilities:

(a) whether there was an anganwadi in the village6
(b) whether there was a trained midwife within 5 kilometres of the village.
(x)

The level of village-level development. On the basis of their general
level of facilities7, the 1,758 villages in the NCAER Survey were
classified as (a) low-development villages; (b) medium-development
villages; (c) high-development villages.

Table 1 shows the distribution of some of these characteristics across the
4,333 children analysed. Of the 2,269 boys in the sample, 55% had been fully
vaccinated and 26% received a nutritious diet while, of the 2,064 girls in the
sample, 50% had been fully vaccinated and 23% received a nutritious diet.
The proportion of children who were fully vaccinated and who received a
nutritious diet was substantially higher when their mothers were literate (66%
and 32%, respectively) than when their mothers were proximate literate (59%
and 28%) or illiterate (42% and 18%).
In the context of caste and religion, the proportion of children fully vaccinated
was lowest for Muslims (40%) and highest for Hindus (60%); on the other

5

The North was treated as the residual region.
Anganwadis are village-based early childhood development centres. They were devised in
the early 1970s as a baseline village health centre, their role being to: provide governmentfunded food supplements to pregnant women and children under five; work as an
immunisation outreach agent; provide information about nutrition and balanced feeding and
provide vitamin supplements; run adolescent girls‟ and women‟s groups; and monitor the
growth, and promote the educational development, of children in a village.

For example: quality of roads; presence of transport, educational, health care, financial and
commercial facilities.

hand, in terms of diet, there was not much difference between Dalits, Muslims
and Hindus in the proportion of children receiving a nutritious diet.
The proportions of fully vaccinated children and children receiving a nutritious
diet in households with „empowered females‟ (as defined above) was much
higher (61% and 29%) than the corresponding proportions in households with
„non-empowered‟ females (46% and 22%).
There was, as Table 1 shows, considerable difference between poor and nonpoor households in the proportions of children fully vaccinated and receiving a
nutritious diet. Some of the poverty-related aspects of vaccination and diet
are reflected in the occupations of the parents. Households in which the
mother worked, either as a labourer or as a cultivator, had much lower
proportion of children receiving a nutritious diet than households in which the
mother was not working.
Table 1 also demonstrates strong regional differences in the proportions of
children fully vaccinated and receiving a nutritious diet: in the more
prosperous parts of India – the West, the North and the South – over 70% of
children were fully vaccinated while, in the less prosperous parts – the Centre
and the East – less than half the children were fully vaccinated.
In terms of health care facilities, the two most important items were the easy
access to a trained midwife and the presence of an anganwadi in a village: a
higher proportion of children living in the presence of these facilities were fully
vaccinated (63% for midwife and 62% for anganwadi) than the corresponding
proportion of children living without these facilities (48% for „no midwife‟ and
46% for „no anganwadi‟).

Econometric Results
Table 2 and 4 show, respectively, the logit estimation results from the
vaccination and the diet equations, both equations estimated separately for
boys and for girls, and Tables 3 and 5 show the associated equation

7

statistics8. For each of the equations, variables whose associated coefficients
were „insignificant‟ (defined as a z-score less than 1) in the boys‟ and the girls‟
specifications were dropped from both specifications; otherwise they were
retained in both specifications. While there was an a priori specification of the
equations (discussed above ),

the data was used to see how this

specification was borne out empirically.

Since there was no theoretical

reason for including such variables they were excluded on the ground of
empirical irrelevance: such variables did not make a “significant” contribution
to the explanatory power of either equation; indeed, in the context of a linear
equation, the inclusion of variables with a z-score of less than unity would
have reduced the adjusted R2 value and, arguably, misspecified the equation.

So In consequence, the same set of variables entered the vaccination
equation for boys and for girls: for some of these variables, the associated
coefficients were significantly different from zero for both genders; for others,
the associated coefficients were significantly different from zero for one
gender, but not for the other9. Ditto for the diet equation.
It was clear from the estimation results that, in the presence of the
consumption assets index, there was little extra mileage to be gained from
the business assets index or from the income variable, expressed either as
household income or as quintile of household income. In both the vaccination
and the diet equations, the z-scores associated with the coefficients on these
variables were less than 1, for both the male and the female specifications.
Consequently, they do not feature in Tables 2 and 4. Identical comments
apply with respect to any of the variables which, though catalogued in the list
of possible covariates, do not appear in Table 2 and/or Table 4.
Tables 2 and 4 also show the marginal probabilities associated with the
different explanatory variables. For discrete variables, taking the value 0 or 1,

8

The equations were also estimated as a probit but there was little difference, in terms of the
marginal probabilities and the standard errors, between the logit and probit models. The
equations were also estimated with „robust‟ standard errors, but there was little difference
between the „conventional‟ standard errors and the „robust‟ standard errors.

8

the effect is calculated as the change in the average probability of the
outcome when the value of the variable changes from 0 to 1, the values of the
other variables being held at their mean values. For the only continuous
variable – the consumption assets index – the probability change was
calculated consequent upon an unit increase in the value of the index.
Tables 2 and 4 also report, parenthetically, the standard errors associated
with the marginal probabilities. These standard errors, in conjunction with the
estimated marginal probabilities for boys and for girls, can be used to test the
null hypothesis that there was no gender difference in the underlying
probabilities against the null hypothesis that there was a gender difference 10.
For none of the estimated marginal probabilities – except for the marginal
probability of being fully immunised under the circumstance of maternal
literacy - was the null hypothesis of “no gender difference” accepted.
Consequently, one could say that a unit change in the explanatory variables
would – with the exception noted earlier – lead to a change in the average
probability of boys being fully vaccinated, and of receiving a nutritious diet,
that would be significantly different from the corresponding probability
changes for girls.
Leaving aside the regional effects, the marginal probabilities of being fully
immunised and of receiving a nutritious diet were highest when ceteris
paribus the children had literate mothers: this raised the likelihood of boys and
of girls being fully immunised by fourteen (percentage) points and of receiving
a nutritious diet by, respectively, eight and fifteen percentage points. Indeed,
when mothers were literate, the gender bias against girls, in their likelihood of
receiving a nutritious diet, was nullified and, indeed, reversed with the
likelihood of girls receiving a nutritious diet (32%) being slightly higher than
that for boys (31%). However, maternal literacy, by raising the likelihood of

„interaction‟ terms in non-linear models.

9

being fully immunised by the same amount for boys as for girls, did nothing to
erode the five point „immunisation gap‟ between boys and girls.
Table 1 shows that the likelihood of being fully vaccinated varied according to
whether the child came from a: Dalit; Muslim; or Hindu family. Ceteris
paribus, as Table 2 shows, the likelihood of boys and girls being fully
vaccinated would fall by six and nine points, respectively, if they were Dalits
and by ten and twelve points, respectively, if they were Muslim 11. So, not only
did Dalit and Muslim parents have, relative to Hindus, a lower propensity to
fully immunise their children, they also embedded a gender bias into this
lower propensity. Table 4 shows that ceteris paribus having Dalit parents
reduced the likelihood of girls receiving a nutritious diet by four points.
As Table 1 showed, there were considerable differences between the regions
both in the proportion of children who were fully vaccinated and in the
proportion who were receiving a nutritious diet. The worst performing region
was the East, with only 39% of children fully vaccinated and only 15%
receiving a nutritious diet. In all the regions, approximately 20%-25% of the
parents who did not have their children fully immunised gave as their reason a
“fear of an adverse reaction”. However, the main difference between the
richer regions (West, North and South) and the poorer regions (Central and
East) was the non-availability of vaccines: non-availability was cited as the
reason for incomplete (including no) vaccination in the case of 14% of the
non-vaccinated children in the East but only 4% of the non-vaccinated
children in the West. Poor organisation also played a major role in children
not being fully vaccinated: in the low immunisation regions of the East and the
Centre, nearly 15% of incomplete vaccinations were due to the place/time of

The Indian news magazine Outlook reported (24 February 2003, p. 70) that Muslim children
accounted for 60% of the polio cases in the largest Indian state, Uttar Pradesh. This was
because of a feeling among Muslims that polio vaccination was “dangerous medicine”, which
would cause impotence and infertility among vaccinated children, and should, therefore, be
shunned.

10

immunisation not being known; in the high immunisation regions of the West
and the South, only 4% cited this as a reason. These features were reflected
in the computed marginal probabilities of Table 2: living in the East reduced
the likelihood of being fully immunised by twenty five points for boys and by
twenty eight points for girls; the corresponding reductions from living in the
Central region were eighteen and nineteen points, respectively.
The fact that 45% of children in the North, but only 15% of children in the
East, received a nutritious diet (Table 1) had much to do with the availability
and price of food, in particular milk, in these regions. Although there was
hardly any difference between the North and the East in household
consumption of cereals and pulses and of vegetables and fruits, there was
considerable difference between the two regions in their respective milk
consumption: the average, monthly, household consumption of milk and milkrelated products was 64 kg in the North but only 7 kg in the East. Once again,
these features are reflected in the computed marginal probabilities of Table 4:
living in the East reduced the likelihood of receiving a nutritious diet by twenty
one points for boys and by twenty points for girls; the corresponding
reductions from living in the Central region were eleven and seventeen points,
respectively.
The econometric results showed that of the different types of health care
facilities in a village (pharmacy; dispensary; hospital) only two really exercised
a significant effect on the likelihood of children being fully vaccinated: the
presence in a village of an anganwadi(s) and the easy access of villagers to
the services of a trained midwife. However, as Table 2 shows, it was only
boys who were the beneficiaries of these facilities: the marginal probabilities
of boys being fully vaccinated were eleven and five per cent in the presence,
respectively, of midwives and anganwadis but these facilities did not affect
the marginal probabilities of girls being fully vaccinated.

11

The Decomposition of the Gender-Based Immunisation and
Nutrition Gaps
The analysis of the previous sections revolved around the gender-based
immunisation and nutrition gaps, defined, respectively, as the difference
between boys and girls in their average probabilities (sample proportions) of
being fully immunised and of receiving a nutritious diet. These gaps were
engendered by the fact that parents valued girls less than they did boys. A
plausible explanation for this stems from the practice of „patrilocal exogamy‟
whereby adult males, even after marriage, continue to live with their parents
and contribute to the household economy, while adult females, after marriage,
leave the parental home (often with a dowry that her parents can ill-afford) to
live in their husbands‟ households (Foster and Rosenzweig, 2001). As a
consequence, investment in girls yields parents a lower return than
investment in boys12.
A corollary of this is that, as noted earlier, girls faced both natal and mortality
inequality. There is, however, the possibility that the incidence of natal
inequality could be higher in certain types of families (and in certain regions)
than others – the fact that the practice of natal inequality requires knowing
that the sex of the foetus can be determined; the ability to pay for sexselective abortions; and the supply of appropriate medical facilities, means
that such inequality might be more prevalent among better-off and bettereducated parents and in more prosperous regions13. This has two
implications:
(i)

Girls born to parents who were able to practice natal inequality are
more likely to be fully immunised and to receive a nutritious diet than
girls born to parents who are unable to practice natal inequality, simply

12

Though the gender ratio is much better in the South than in the North of India. Some
demographers believe that the dominant Aryan culture of the North – with its emphasis on
caste hierarchy, patrilineal inheritance and male kinship patterns – is different from the
Dravidian (indigenous) culture of the South where women play a prominent part in society and
in the economy (Financial Times, 8/9 Febraury, 2003, p. III).
13
In the northern states of Punjab and Haryana, the two richest Indian states, ultrasound tests
for determining the sex of the foetus have become routine making it easier to identify and
abort female foetuses (Financial Times op. cit.).

12

because the former set of parents are better off/better educated than
the latter set.
(ii)

Girls born to parents who were able to practice natal inequality are
more likely to be „wanted‟ children and, therefore, not discriminated
against (in favour of their brothers) to the same degree as the
„unwanted‟ girls born to parents who were unable to practice – did not
know about – natal inequality. The point is that, for individual families,
the practice of natal and mortality inequality might be inversely related.

Under these circumstances, the immunisation and nutrition gaps that girls
experienced may have been partly due to the fact that they were
discriminated against, in favour of their brothers, and partly due to the fact
that, relative to boys, they were more likely to be born in families in which all
children, irrespective of gender, were disadvantaged with respect to
immunisation and diet. The contribution of the „discrimination‟ and the
„residual‟ factors to the immunisation (and the nutrition gaps) may be
disentangled by means of the decomposition formulas14:
and

IMN B  IMN G  [ P ( XGi ,βˆ B )  P ( XGi ,βˆ G )]  [ P ( XiB ,βˆ B )  P ( XGi ,βˆ B )]

(2)

IMN B  IMN G  [ P ( XBi ,βˆ B )  P ( XBi ,βˆ G )]  [ P ( XBi ,βˆ G )  P ( XGi ,βˆ G )]

(3)

The superscripts B and G in equations (2) and (3) refer to boys and girls; the

X i and the β̂ are, respectively, the vectors of observations on the variables
and the estimated coefficients; IMN B  P ( XBi , βˆ B ) and IMN G  P ( XGi , βˆ G ) are
the sample proportions (average probabilities) of boys and girls who are fully
vaccinated; P ( XGi , βˆ B ) is the average probability of being fully vaccinated when
girls are treated as boys; P ( XBi , βˆ G ) is the average probability of being fully
vaccinated when boys are treated as girls.
Equation (2) decomposes the immunisation gap between boys and girls as
the sum of a „discrimination factor‟ (the difference between what the average

13

probability of girls being fully immunised would have been, had they been
treated as boys, and the sample proportion of fully immunised girls) and a
„residual‟ factor. This is the logit extension of the (regression based) Oaxaca
(1973) type decomposition. Equation (3) does the same but defines
discrimination as the difference between the sample proportion of fully
immunised boys and what the average probability of boys being fully
immunised would have been, had they been treated as girls). Identical
decomposition exercises, alà equations (2) and (3), can be performed with
respect to the nutritional gap between boys and girls.
Table 6 shows that 83% of the immunisation gap, and 91% of the nutritional
gap, between boys and girls could be explained by the fact that girls were
treated differently from boys and the remainder was due to the fact that girls
were born to less advantageous familial circumstances than boys.

The Decomposition of Inequality in the Distribution of
Likelihoods
The previous section used the econometric estimates (shown in Tables 2 and
4) to decompose the difference between boys and girls in the average
proportions of those fully immunised (the immunisation gap) and those
receiving a nutritious diet (the nutrition gap). However, the estimated
equations allow these probabilities of being fully immunised and of receiving a
nutritious diet to be predicted for each child in the sample, conditional upon
the relevant values of the determining variables for the child. Armed with a
knowledge of these individual probabilities, one can estimate how much of
the overall inequality in these probabilities can be explained by a particular
factor. For example, how much of the inequality in the 4,333 probabilities of
being fully vaccinated can be accounted for by differences in: gender;
maternal literacy status; region; caste/religion?

formulas of equations (2) and (3).

This section provides an answer to this question, using the methodology of
„inequality decomposition‟. Suppose that the sample of N=4,333 children is
divided into M mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive groups with Nm
(m=1…M) persons in each group. Let p  { pi } and pm  { pi } represent the
vector of (estimated) probabilities of being fully vaccinated of, respectively, all
the children in sample (i=1…N) and the children in group m. Then an
inequality index I (p; N ) defined over this vector is said to be additively
decomposable if:
M

I (p; N )   I (pm ; N m ) wm  B  A  B

(4)

m 1

where: I (p; N ) represents the overall level of inequality; I (pm ; Nm ) represents
the level of inequality within group m; A – expressed as the weighted sum of
the inequality in each group, wm being the weights – and B represent,
respectively, the within-group and the between-group contribution to overall
inequality.
If, indeed, inequality can be „additively decomposed‟ along the lines of
equation (4) above, then, as Cowell and Jenkins (1995) have shown, the
proportionate contribution of the between-group component (B) to overall
inequality is the income inequality literature‟s analogue of the R2 statistic used
in regression analysis: the size of this contribution is a measure of the amount
of inequality that can be „explained‟ by the factor (or factors) used to subdivide
the sample (gender; maternal literacy status etc.).
Only inequality indices which belong to the family of Generalised Entropy
Indices are additively decomposable (Shorrocks, 1980). These indices are
defined by a parameter  and, when =0, the weights are the population
shares of the different groups (that is, w j  N j / N ); since the weights sum to
unity, the within-group contribution A of equation (4) is a weighted average of
the inequality levels within the groups. When =0, the inequality index takes
the form:

 N

I (p; N )    log( pi / p)  / N
 i 1


15

(5)

N

where: p   pi / N is the mean probability over the entire sample. The
i 1

inequality index defined in equation (5) is known as the Theil‟s (1967) Mean
Logarithmic Deviation (MLD) and, because of its attractive features in terms of
the interpretation of the weights, it was the one used in this study to
decompose inequality in the likelihood of being fully vaccinated and of
receiving a nutritious diet.
Table 7 shows the results from decomposing these likelihoods by subdividing
the sample of 4,333 children along one of the following lines:
(i)

gender

(ii)

maternal literacy status

(iii)

caste/religion

(iv)

region

These results, in turn, highlight three points.
The first is that the level of inequality associated with the distribution of the
two likelihoods, across the 4,333 children, was actually quite low. The values
of the MLD index (and of the Gini coefficient) were 0.07 and 0.09 (0.22 and
0.24, for the Gini), respectively, for vaccination and diet15. By contrast, the
distribution of incomes, across the households in which these children lived,
had an associated MLD value of 0.44 and a Gini value of 0.50.
The second point is that gender provided a very poor explanation for the
observed inequality in the distributions of the likelihood of being fully
vaccinated and of receiving a nutritious diet: when the sample of children was
subdivided by gender, only 2% of overall inequality was due to between-group
inequality and 98% was due to inequality within the subgroups of boys and of
girls. Maternal literacy proved to have better explanatory power: when the
sample of children was subdivided according to the literacy status of the
mothers (literate; proximate literate; illiterate), 25% of overall inequality in the
distribution of vaccination likelihoods, and 27% of overall inequality in the

15

distribution of nutritious diet likelihoods, was due to between-group inequality.
However, the best explanation for inequality in the distribution of the
likelihoods was region: when the sample of children was subdivided according
to the regions in which they lived (Central; South; West; East; North) then
60% of the overall inequality in the distribution of vaccination likelihoods, and
50% of overall inequality in the distribution of nutritious diet likelihoods, could
be ascribed to regional differences16 (Caldwell, 1993).
The third point is that although the overall level of inequality in the distribution
of the vaccination and the nutritious diet likelihoods was low, the betweengroup contribution to this inequality – whether through differences in
caste/religion; or maternal literacy status; or region – was very high. For
example, in contrast, the contributions of regional differences; of differences in
caste/religion; and of differences in maternal literacy status to overall
inequality in the distribution of household incomes (of the 4,333 children)
were, respectively, only: 4%, 9% and 11%.

Conclusions
There can be little doubt that for many children living in the poorer parts of the
world, life is not easy. High rates of infant mortality mean that more than a
quarter of new born babies often do not live out their first year; if they do, the
survivors are prey to further disease and illnesses which often leave them
severely malnourished; to add to this litany, the high incidence of child labour
means that, for many children, childhood and schooling are sacrificed at the
altar of economic necessity. In summary, many children in developing
countries suffer from a general, and often severe, neglect of their welfare.
One aspect of the neglect of children that has rightly received a great deal of
attention in the literature is the neglect of girls, relative to boys (Sen, 2001;
Osmani, 2001). Indeed, in the context of India, the results from the latest
(2001) Census have led to considerable concern about the decline in the sex

16

That is, was due to between-group inequality. Note also that differences in caste/religion
provided a less adequate explanation for inequality than either regional differences or

17

ratio of the population aged 0-6 years from 945/1,000 in 1991 to 927/1,000 in
2001 (Premi, 2001).
This paper examined the extent to which girls between 1-2 years were
neglected, relative to boys of the same age, in two respects: (i) being fully
immunised against tuberculosis, polio, diptheria-pertussis-tetanus, and
measles (ii) receiving a nutritious diet containing milk, cereals and pulses and
vegetables/fruit. The conclusion of this paper is that girls were undoubtedly
disadvantaged in both respects. In respect of vaccinations, the likelihood of
girls being fully vaccinated, after controlling for other variables, was five
percentage points lower than that for boys. In respect of receiving a nutritious
diet, the treatment of girls depended very much on whether or not their
mothers were literate: there was no gender discrimination between children of
literate mothers; on the other hand, when the mother was illiterate, girls were
five percentage points less likely to be well-fed relative to their brothers and
the presence of a literate father did little to dent this gender gap.
But the main conclusion of this paper is that all children in India suffered
more severe, but less publicised, forms of disadvantage than that engendered
solely by gender. There was, first, the disadvantage that resulted from living
in particularly impoverished parts of an already poor country. Children living
in the Central and the Eastern regions of India, relative to children in other
regions, suffered from a lack of vaccines and the poor organisation of
vaccination facilities. They also suffered from the relative lack of milk in these
regions.
The second form of disadvantage, from which all children suffered, was being
born to mothers who were illiterate: the likelihood of children whose mothers
were literate of being fully vaccinated and of receiving a nutritious diet were,
respectively, 67% and 32%; these fell to 52% and 25% when the mothers
were proximate literate and fell further to 42% and 18% when the mothers
were illiterate.

differences in maternal literacy status.

18

The third form of disadvantage stemmed from the communities (defined in
terms of caste/religion) to which the children belonged: the likelihood of Hindu
children being fully vaccinated was, twenty percentage points higher than that
for Muslim children.
These conclusions, based on an analysis of average probabilities, was
confirmed when the focus was shifted to an analysis of the distribution of the
individual probabilities. Once again, the capacity of region, maternal literacy
status and caste/religion to explain inequality in this distribution was much
greater than that of gender. In summary, therefore, this study suggests that
the issue of „children‟s neglect‟ – at least as far as India goes - is one that has
many facets. There is, of course, the very important aspect of gender
discrimination and, indeed, this is the aspect that has attracted the most
attention. But, no less important, are the relative disadvantages, from which
boys and girls in India suffered, stemming from being born to the „wrong‟
mothers, belonging to the „wrong‟ community and living in the „wrong‟ region.
That is the central message of this paper.

Data Appendix
The data used in this paper were obtained from the National Council of Applied Economic
Research (NCAER) Human Development Survey, described in Shariff (1999). This survey commissioned by the Indian Planning Commission and funded by a consortium of United
Nations agencies - was carried out by the NCAER over January-June 1994 and most of the
data from the survey pertains to the year prior to the survey, that is to 1993-94. These data
are based on unit record data from a survey of 33,000 rural households - encompassing
195,000 individuals - which were spread over 1,765 villages, in 195 districts, in 16 states of
India. Details of the survey - hereafter referred to as the NCAER Survey - are to be found in
Shariff (1999), though some of the salient features of data from the NCAER Survey, insofar
as they are relevant to this study, are described in this Appendix.

The Survey used rural female literacy and income from agriculture as stratification variables
for the districts: in each state, districts were cross-classified by rural female literacy and by
income from agriculture to form a homogenous strata with respect to these two variables.
From each of these strata, a pre-assigned number of districts were selected with probability
proportional to the rural population of the district. Then, a list of villages in the selected
districts was obtained from census records. A pre-assigned number of sample villages were
selected after arranging the villages in a tehsil (an administrative block) in ascending and
descending order of female literacy. The households in the chosen villages were listed along
17

with some other auxiliary information of the households . Two groups of listed households
were separated as Stratum 1 and Stratum 2, respectively:
(i)

Households with at least one pregnant woman

(ii)

Households with at least one child less than 12 months, but no pregnant woman.

The remaining households were stratified according religion (Hindu, Muslim etc.), caste group
18

(SCT, non-SCT) and the occupation of the head of household .

A comprehensive survey instrument was canvassed to one or more adult household
members by a team comprising a trained female and a male investigator. All those involved
with the survey were trained at state level and the survey instrument was translated into the
local languages. A comprehensive village schedule was also made to collect communitylevel information.
The data from the NCAER survey are organised as a number of „reference‟ files, with each
file focusing on specific subgroups of individuals. However, the fact that in every file an
individual was identified by a household number and, then, by an identity number within the
household, meant that the „reference‟ files could be joined – as will be described below – to
form larger files.

So, for example, the 'vaccination' and the 'diet' equations were estimated on data from the
„children‟ file. This file, as the name suggests, gave information on those individuals in the
sample who were between the ages of 0-12, with particular reference to their health-related
environment. In particular, this file contained information on their vaccination record and on
their diet. Information on the vaccination record of children was, however, only collected for
those children between the ages of 1-2 years. This age restriction was also applied, in this
study, to the diet equation yielding a total sample of 4,333 children – of whom, 2,269 were
boys and 2,064 were girls - all of whom were between the ages of 1-2 years (inclusive).
These data were then used to construct the binary variables Ri and Si (described above). Of
the 4,333 children studied, 53% had been fully vaccinated (Ri=1) and 25% were given a
nutritious diet (Si=1).
To the children's file was appended the 'household file': this associated with each child,
information on the economic and social circumstances of his/her household. The third, and
last, appendage to the children's file was the „village file‟ which contained data relating to the
existence of infrastructure in, and around, each of the 1,765 villages over which the survey
was conducted: this then yielded information on the health-related facilities in child‟s
geographical vicinity.
