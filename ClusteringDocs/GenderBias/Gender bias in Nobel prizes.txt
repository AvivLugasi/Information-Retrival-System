ABSTRACT Strikingly few Nobel laureates within medicine, natural and social sciences are
women. It is obvious that there are fewer women researchers within these ﬁelds, but does
this still fully account for the low number of female Nobel laureates? We examine whether
women are awarded the Nobel Prizes less often than the gender ratio suggests. Based on
historical data across four scientiﬁc ﬁelds and a Bayesian hierarchical model, we quantify any
possible bias. The model reveals, with exceedingly large conﬁdence, that indeed women are
strongly under-represented among Nobel laureates across all disciplines examined.

Introduction
n 2018, Professor D. Strickland received the Nobel Prize in
Physics as the ﬁrst woman in 55 years. From 1901 to 2018, the
Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded 112 times to 209
different candidates; among these are only two more women;
namely M. Curie in 1903 and M. Goeppert Mayer in 1963.
Women have historically occupied much fewer positions in
academia than men have; hence, it is natural to expect more male
Nobel laureates than female. However, the ratio of women in
scientiﬁc professions has increased in all ﬁelds of science over the
last decades (Shen, 2013). Despite this fundamental shift in the
demography, the ratio of women Nobel laureates is still low and
gives the impression of an increasing gender gap (Modgil et al.,
2018). This gap is partially accounted for by the age discrimination of Nobel Prizes as laureates most often are well
established senior researchers (Agarwal, 2018). In case seniority is
the only important factor, we expect the Nobel awards to follow a
binomial distribution with a probability given by the gender ratio
among professors. For instance, if there is 10% women, we expect
ceteris paribus a 10% chance that a woman is awarded the Nobel
Prize. So does the gender ratio truly account for the few female
Nobel laureates?
To investigate this, we compared the gender ratio of Nobel
laureates in Physics; Chemistry, Economics, Physiology, and
Medicine to the relevant gender ratios among scientists in the
ﬁeld. We use the gender distribution of senior faculty members in
the US as proxy for a worldwide distribution and observe that
women are awarded the Nobel Prize far less often than the faculty
gender ratios suggest. More speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd the probability
that the distribution of Nobel Prizes is not favouring men, to be
less than 4% for within all of the investigated ﬁelds.
Methods
We used data of faculty members resolved on gender and ﬁelds
from the National Science Foundation2 as a proxy for a global
distribution. This data only covers the period from 1973 to 2010;
hence, we extrapolated the data with a logistic function to obtain
the gender ratios, r, for different ﬁelds from 1901 to 2010. We
note that the average age for Nobel laureates is 55 years and the
ﬁndings, worthy of a Nobel Prize, are on average done 15 years
earlier (Nobel, 2019). While we do not have access to the number
of female and male faculty members, resolved by age, we deﬁne a
lag time, δ. With this, we presume that the relevant research
originate from senior faculty members δ years before.
We use a hierarchical Bayesian inference model and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling (Carpenter et al., 2017). We model

the number of women laureates, fij, within the scientiﬁc ﬁeld j, in
year i as a stochastic binomial variable:
fij  BðNij ; θij Þ;

where B is the binomial distribution. Nij and θij are the number of
Nobel Prizes awarded and the corresponding success probability,
i.e., the probability of a women being awarded, in year i, within
the ﬁeld j, respectively. In the case of no bias, we expect θij to be
equal to the gender ratio, ri−δ,j some δ years earlier. In order to
quantify any bias we model the success probability, θij as

Results
Since the ﬁrst Nobel Prizes were awarded in 1901 there has been
688 Nobel laureates within the ﬁelds of Chemistry, Economics,
Physics, and Medicine; among these are only 20 women (21
prizes as M. Curie received the prize twice), see Fig. 1. Among the
Nobel laureates of economics there is one woman; namely Professor E. Ostrom (2009) which corresponds to 2%. In Medicine,
12 women have been awarded over the years which 6% of the
laureates. It is obvious that these differences reﬂect, to some
extent, the gender ratios within the ﬁeld. However, the gender

where N is the normal distribution. We notice that for μ = 0 we
have that Median (αj) = 1 corresponding to no gender bias.
Hence, we choose a weakly informative prior distribution for αj
with a median of 1, see Fig. 3. We further note that the results
were found signiﬁcantly robust on the choice of the hyper
parameter μ (Eq. (4)) and on the standard deviation of the normal
distribution, Eq. (5).

where αj is a positive, time independent, stochastic variable. We
note that for rij << 1 and αjrij << 1 we can approximate Eq. (2) to
the simple relation θij = αjrij Here, αj is a bias parameter, such
that when αj = 1, we have θij = rij i.e., women are awarded the
Nobel Prize exactly as often as the gender ratio suggests. We use a
hierarchical structure for the variable α, assuming, for each scientiﬁc ﬁeld, j, that the mean and standard deviation of log(αj) is
drawn from stochastic (hyper) variables μ and σ. Hence, we
assume some similarity between the four different αj’s. We use

distribution of faculty members evolves and for every instance in
time, the gender distribution among senior faculty members is
different from junior faculty members. As the average age of
Nobel laureates is 55 years (Nobel, 2019), we assume that the
Nobel laureates are sampled from a gender distribution of senior
faculty members. Moreover, Nobel laureates did their ground
breaking ﬁndings a few decades prior to the award (the average is
15 years (Nobel, 2019)). To account for this, we assume that
today’s Nobel laureates are sampled from senior faculty members
δ years ago.
We examined the fraction of female faculty members relative to
all faculty members which we denoted gender ratio, r. We used
the gender ratios of senior faculty members at US university
departments as a proxy for a global distribution. The data were
retrieved from the National Science Foundation (NSF, 2018) and
covers the period from 1973 to 2010. For completeness, we ﬁtted
with a logistic function and extrapolated the data back in time to
cover the entire period of Nobel awards from 1901 to 2010, see
Fig. 2. In the data, both Chemistry and Physics are gathered
under Physical sciences. Hence, we used this gender ratio for both
the Physics and Chemistry Nobel Prizes. Furthermore, for the
Nobel Prize in Economics we used the gender ratio of senior
faculty members from Social sciences. Most probably, this leads
to a slight overestimation of the bias within economics, since
economics may have a smaller gender ratio than the overall ratio
within Social sciences. We use a hierarchical model to quantify
possible gender bias in the awarding of Nobel Prizes using
Bayesian inference through Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling,
see Methods section. The gender bias is described by the parameter α and when α < 1(α > 1) women are awarded the Nobel
Prize less (more) often than the gender ratio suggests. The
sampled prior and posterior probability density distributions, p(α|
r, δ), is illustrated in Fig. 3, for a lag of δ = 10 and ratios r. From
the prior distribution (grey), we conﬁrm that we chose a weakly
informative prior, allowing value of α both well below and above
1. For all four Nobel Prizes, the posterior distributions shows a
signiﬁcant bias against women with mean values of the posterior
probability density 〈α〉 < 1 and
R 1 a total probability of being larger
than unity, Pðα  1Þ ¼ 1  0 pðαjr; δ Þdα, found to be less than
a few percent. To investigate how sensitive the measured bias is to
the choice of δ we repeated the analysis in the range from 0 ≤ δ ≤
20. For all values of δ, sample values of α were predominantly
smaller than unity. This is summarized in Fig. 4, which shows the
probability of α being larger than 1, P(α ≥ 1) versus delay, δ.
We anticipate that the variations within the different ﬁelds, to
some extent, reﬂect the granularity of categories in the historical
gender ratios. For instance, for Economics (blue curve) we
probably overestimated the bias by comparing with the gender

Fig. 3 Prior (grey) and posterior (orange) probability density of α, for
δ = 10. The prior distribution was set giving a median of 1, see Eq. (3) and
Eq. (4). Values of α less (more) than unity signify fewer (more) Nobel
Prizes awarded women than the gender ratio suggests

ratio within Social Sciences (where we believe the ratio is larger).
In contrast, for Chemistry (red curve) we were likely to underestimate the bias as we collated the prizes with the ratio of
Physical Sciences, which includes both Physics and Chemistry.
Therefore, we do not conclude that Nobel Prizes for some scientiﬁc ﬁeld have a larger bias, than for others. Regardless of this,
we ﬁnd that the possibility that Nobel laureates are awarded
without disfavouring women is less than 4% for lag times less
than 20 years. This ﬁrm evidence shows that women are disfavoured, i.e., female senior scientists are less likely to be awarded
a Nobel Prize than their gender ratio suggests. Furthermore, one
could argue that the ﬁndings are often done early in the career,
i.e., before tenure, where gender ratios are more balanced. If this
is true, our model underestimates the bias against women.
Discussion
The last 15 years 10 women were honoured with the Nobel Prize
within Physics, Chemistry, Economics, and Medicine and Physiology this is exactly the same as the ﬁrst 100 years of the Nobel
Prize’s history (11 prices as M. Curie received it twice). Despite
this fact, using a hierarchical Bayesian interference model, we
found that the gender distribution in Nobel Prizes includes a bias
against women with more than ~96% probability. Hence, even
women that resist the leaky pipeline (Pell, 1996; Goulden et al.,
2009) and become permanent staff members do not have equal
chances to be awarded the Nobel Prize.
However, our models do not propose that this bias arises from
an unfair evaluation of nominees by the Nobel committees.

Unfortunately, we do not have the possibility to test this
hypothesis as nominators (and nominees) are guaranteed full
anonymity for 50 years (Nobel, 2019). Nevertheless, we believe
that this divergence occurs at multiple earlier steps in the careers
of potential Nobel laureates. This means that there is not an equal
possibility for both genders to be nominated for a Nobel Prize.
We speculate that there are limitations for women to enter the
pool of very well esteemed scientists worthy of a nomination. This
hindrance could be related to family life; as female laureates are
signiﬁcantly less likely to be married (63 versus 97%) and/or have
children (55 versus 86%) than their male counterparts (Charyton
et al., 2011). This is in accordance with the general assumption
that carrying obligations is one of the main causes of pipeline
leaks (Fig. 1 in Ref. (Goulden et al., 2009)). Combined with a lack
of role models (Robinson, 2011) an academic career is less
attractive for the junior faculties’ women (Fig. 8 in Ref. (Goulden
et al., 2009)). Furthermore, there are indications that men in
academia are more likely to be provided the resources and support needed for an excellent scientiﬁc production (Xie and
Shauman, 2003). In contrast, due to fewer resources, women’s
publication index remains low and consequently they are less
likely to be nominated to the prestigious award. This is reﬂected
by the fact that female laureates have a signiﬁcantly lower publication index than their male counterpart (on average 219 versus
358) (Charyton et al., 2011). These differences in family obligations and resources suggests that men are more prone to end up
in the pool of possible Nobel nominees.
We are aware that the gender bias is likely to be one bias
among many, e.g., afﬁliation, sexuality, and nationality, retractable from the set of Nobel laureates in Science. Nevertheless, we
ﬁnd the gender ratio is symptomatic in the sense, that women
should have nothing else against them to be awarded the Nobel
Prize (Abir-Am, 2010). Therefore, these results are not only of
relevance for future Nobel laureates, but for all future faculty
members.
