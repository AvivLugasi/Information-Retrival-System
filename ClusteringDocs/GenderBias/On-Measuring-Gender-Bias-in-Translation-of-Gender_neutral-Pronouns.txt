   For (a), optimizing L1 = xy subject to x + y =

                                   1

                                   4
For (b) (and possibly (c)), optimizing L2 = z sub-

                min = 0, max = 1                   (11)
From eqn.s (9,10), we have 0 ≤ W ≤ 1 which
yields the boundedness of the proposed measure
W0 . Moreover, we obtain that W0 is maximized if
pn = 1 and minimized if either pw or pm = 1.
