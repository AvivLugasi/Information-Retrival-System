Is there a bias against women’s representation in Wikipedia biographies? Thousands of
biographical subjects from six sources are compared against the English-language
Wikipedia and the online Encyclopædia Britannica with respect to coverage, gender
representation, and article length. We conclude that Wikipedia provides better coverage
and longer articles, and that it typically has more articles on women than Britannica in
absolute terms, but we also find that Wikipedia articles on women are more likely to be
missing than are articles on men relative to Britannica. For both reference works, article
length did not consistently differ by gender.
Introduction
Wikipedia’s self-description as “the encyclopedia that anyone can edit” is evidence of two key
influences. Obviously, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia. While reference works are often thought of as bland
tomes, they are sometimes objects of contention in larger cultural debates about what deserves to be
recognized as knowledge (Einbinder, 1964; Morton, 1994). Also, Wikipedia is a wiki, a Web-based editing
platform made popular by those who prefer simple and open collaboration (Cunningham, 2004). Indeed,
Wikipedia was inspired by the growing strength of the larger free/libre and open-source software (FLOSS)
movement whereby software is shared and developed in the open. However, instead of software code,
Wikipedians produce encyclopedic prose.
Yet, Wikipedia also (seemingly) inherits an unfortunate trait from its reference work and technical
ancestors: In the realm of reference work production, women’s representation as contributors and
subjects has been slight. In her study of the Encyclopædia Britannica, historian Gillian Thomas notes that,
as contributors, women were relegated to matters of “social and purely feminine affairs”—as stated by an

early 20th century editor—and were “perceived as acting as pedantic handmaidens to the wide-ranging
sweep of male intelligence” (Thomas, 1992, pp. 18, 26). As subjects, women were often little more than
addendums to male biographies (e.g., Marie Curie as the husband of Pierre Curie). In the realm of
technology, the gender imbalance found in computer-related fields is exacerbated rather than mitigated.
That is, despite a voluntary, egalitarian and meritocratic ethos, women are only a tiny fraction of
participants, as low as 1.1% in an oft-cited FLOSS survey (Ghosh, Glott, Krieger, & Robles, 2002). One
would hope Wikipedia would be more balanced, yet surveys indicate that women constitute around 13% of
Wikipedians (Glott, Schmidt, & Ghosh, 2010).
Such imbalances in participation and representation prompt us to look for indications of “systemic
bias” in the biographical coverage of women at the English-language Wikipedia and online Britannica. In
this article, we introduce Wikipedia, discuss gender bias in references works and technical communities,
and examine prior work on comparative analyses of Wikipedia. Subsequently, we describe a method that
allowed us to obtain thousands of biographies from Wikipedia and Britannica. Our analysis and findings
are then presented via tables of percentages (of men and women whom each work covers) and
complementary logistical regressions.
Background
Wikipedia
Wikipedia’s name is a portmanteau of “wiki,” an online collaborative editing tool, and
“encyclopedia,” itself a contraction of the Greek enkyklios and paidei, referring to the “circle of learning” of
the classical liberal arts. Furthermore, “wiki wiki” means “super fast” in the Hawaiian language, and Ward
Cunningham chose the name in 1995 for his collaborative WikiWikiWeb software to indicate the ease with
which one could edit pages. (He learned of the word during his first visit to Hawaii when he was initially
confused by the direction to take the “Wiki Wiki Bus,” the Honolulu airport shuttle (Cunningham, 2003). In
a sense, the term wiki captures the original conception of the World Wide Web as both a browsing and
editing medium; the latter capability was largely forgotten when the Web began its precipitous growth and
the most popular clients (i.e., “browsers”) did not permit users to edit Web pages.
The wiki changed this asymmetry by placing the editing functionality on the website itself. Using
the Wikipedia syntax, one types “# this provides a link to [[Ward Cunningham]]” to add a numbered list
item with a link to the “Ward Cunningham” article. The Wikipedia software translates this into the
appropriate HTML and hypertext links for users to view. To create a new page, one simply creates a link to
it, which remains red until someone actually adds content to its target destination. These capabilities are
central to and representative of wikis.
Women, FLOSS, and Reference Works
The well-known gender imbalance in computer-related fields—approximately 27% female—is
further exacerbated in the FLOSS community, with women making up about 1.1% of participants (Ghosh

1140 Joseph Reagle & Lauren Rhue

International Journal of Communication 5(2011)

et al., 2002; NCWIT, 2007). Likely hindrances to participation include a lack of mentors and role models,
language usage, a male-dominated competitive world view, lack of women-centered perspectives, other
life demands (e.g., personal time and work), scope of interests, and the identity or construal of women in
the community (Karanović, 2008; Lin, 2005).
The history of reference work production includes notable examples of chauvinism. Robert
Cawdrey’s Table Alphabetical can’t help but be read today as patronizing, given that it was “gathered for
the benefit & helpe of Ladies, Gentlewomen, or any other unskillful persons” (Cawdrey, 1604/1997).
Centuries later, privileged women had greater access to learning and were lauded for supposed feminine
virtues, but otherwise chauvinism persisted. John Ruskin (1910), Victorian art critic and social
commentator, advised that women should be permitted knowledge only such that it “may enable her to
understand, and even to aid the work of men.” That is, “a woman ought to know the same language, or
science, only so far as may enable her to sympathize with her husband’s pleasures, and those of his
friends” (pp. 154–155). Thomas (1992) argued that this attitude was very much reflected in Britannica’s
articles and in the work environment of its female contributors and staff. Thomas notes that at the
beginning of the 20th century the “Women” article can be characterized by its “evasiveness about the
suffrage issue, but praise for women’s special moral qualities and ‘demeanor,’ the apparent credit given to
pioneer women professionals, while at the same time describing them as ‘invaders’ of their chosen fields
of work” (p. 39). In 1942, Mary Ritter Beard led “A Study of the Encyclopædia Britannica in Relation to Its
Treatment of Women.” She and her colleagues found many biases and omissions. For example, their
report noted that the article on “Song” gives the impression that “No women sang in Europe, it appears
from this review. The contributions of nuns, in choir composition and singing, is [sic] not recognized at all”
(Beard, Edinger, Selig, & White, 1977, p. 220).
Furthermore, few women prominently appear in the historical record of reference works. Beyond
those in Thomas’ work, the few exceptions are in the domain of librarians and documentalists, such as
Suzanne Briet (Maack, 2004). Unfortunately, even Melvil Dewey’s advocacy for women in the library
profession is marred by alleged discrimination and personal scandal (Wiegand, 1996). Thomas reported
that of the some 1,500 authors contributing to the 11th Britannica, 35 of them were women (about 2%),
with no woman listed among the 49 editorial advisors (1992, p. 18). Today, at least, women are visible in
everyday tasks and positions of authority at Wikipedia, though they continue to be a minority.
Topical Comparisons and Systemic Bias
While there have been no large-scale comparisons of biographical coverage and gender in
reference works, there are quality and topical coverage comparisons. For example, in a report from the
prestigious science journal Nature, Wikipedia articles were found to contain more errors than did
Britannica articles (Giles, 2005). With respect to topical coverage, George Bragues (2007) compared the
biographical articles of seven prominent philosophers with authoritative reference works and found that
Wikipedia only covers 52% on average (56% median) of topics commonly found in the other reference
works. (No errors were found, though there were significant omissions.) Alexander Halavais and Derek
Lackaff (2008) undertook two analyses of Wikipedia topical coverage and found that Wikipedia does well
with respect to general knowledge (because of its size) and technical issues (likely because of Wikipedia’s

International Journal of Communication 5 (2011)

Gender Bias in Wikipedia and Brittanica 1141

contributors), but it is weak on law and medicine (“the purview of licensed experts” (p. 438)).
Furthermore, comparisons of content between different language versions of Wikipedia reveal divergences
in interlanguage links, information boxes, and topics addressed (Adar, Skinner, & Weld, 2009; Hecht &
Gergle, 2009, 2010).
Among Wikipedians, the likelihood of imbalanced topical coverage has long been acknowledged.
The “Countering Systemic Bias” WikiProject began in the fall of 2004 with discussion of how the interests
and the demographics of its contributors affected its topical coverage (e.g., a “Western” and “geeky”
focus). The project page notes that:
The Wikipedia project suffers systemic bias that naturally grows from its contributors’
demographic groups, manifesting an imbalanced coverage of a subject, thereby
discriminating against the less represented demographic groups. This project aims to
control and (possibly) eliminate the cultural perspective gaps made by the systemic
bias, consciously focusing upon subjects and points of view neglected by the
encyclopedia as a whole. (Wikipedia, 2004, 2009c)
Countering systemic gender bias specifically has also been a concern of the “WikiProject Gender Studies,”
though its subproject on gender bias does not appear to be very active (Wikipedia, 2008, 2009d).
Recent informal studies of gender imbalance indicate a Wikipedia bias. A report by John Limey
(2010) compared the percentage of women in a sample of Wikipedia biographies (19.3%) with in an
online biographical database (29.9%); the 10-point difference is “highly suggestive” of bias. Similarly, an
analysis of the gender balance of people appearing on Wikipedia’s front page finds “Nine men to every one
woman on a portal that represents the greatest easily accessible store of knowledge is outrageously
disproportionate and unacceptable” (RMJ, 2010).
Method
The preceding literature prompted us to ask the following: (1) What kind of gender bias can one
find in existing lists of notable persons; and (2) supposing incomplete encyclopedic coverage of those
sources, how do Britannica and Wikipedia fair? That is, if both works only had biographies for 20% of a
source’s listings, can one discern a further bias in which gender is focused upon by the reference work?
For example, assume a source list has 100 notable persons split evenly between the genders. Because
each reference work only has 20 articles among the 100 subjects, either work could focus on either
gender exclusively in its coverage (i.e., 0–100%), revealing a bias.
To answer this question, a Python program was used to find, “crawl,” and compare Web pages
related to biographical subjects in the targeted reference works. (Unless specified otherwise, these results
are from June 2010.) Biographical subjects were chosen from six sources: The National Women’s History
Project (NWHP), The Atlantic’s 100 most influential figures in American history, TIME Magazine’s list of
2008’s most influential people, Chambers Biographical Dictionary, American National Biography Online,

1142 Joseph Reagle & Lauren Rhue

International Journal of Communication 5(2011)

and Wikipedia itself. Such a task is challenging in that there are often ambiguities inherent in the naming
of subjects, including people with the same name, a single person with different names (e.g., indigenous
and colonial), nicknames, differing transliterations, order, honors, syntactical conventions, and use of
diacritics. Additionally, sources for such names may have their own errors in addition to such variations,
including typos. So as to fairly and accurately test topical coverage of Britannica and Wikipedia, we made
use of the Google search engine, which has indexed both sites.
Google provides a convenient search API to its search engine that has expansive coverage and an
effective search algorithm for natural language queries. Therefore, after converting a biographical source
list into a standard format, the Google API was queried for its top four results for a given name. Queries
were restricted to the content of britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/ and of en.wikipedia.org (excluding doc,
pdf, jpg, gif, and png results). From the query, the results’ titles were normalized (e.g., titles were
lowercased, and hyphens and diacritics were removed). They were then compared with the source name
using a “fuzzy comparison” algorithm (i.e., Python’s difflib Levenshtein-Distance ratio). These comparisons
were augmented with hand-tuned heuristics (e.g., sorting long names that have many honorifics) to
maximize correct matches and minimize false matches. The length of an article is determined by counting
the words of article content (sans markup) and does not include external links, notes, citation information,
and other miscellany.
Gender was primarily guessed via the balance of gendered pronouns used in a biography (i.e.,
he/his and she/her). If the difference between instances of masculine and feminine pronouns is less than
25% of their sum, gender is unknown. This method was tested against the approximately 400 biographies
from the TIME and NWHP lists. For those biographies for which gender was guessed, we manually
confirmed that all guesses were correct. (Anita Hill’s biography was the edge case, coming close to being
labeled as “unknown” given its extensive discussion of Clarence Thomas, that is: she = 37, he = 21; (37–
21)/(37+21) = 28% = female). Those few subjects whose gender could not be guessed by this method
were largely the result of neither reference work having a biographical article. But these subjects are still
amendable to guesses based on honorifics (e.g., Count vs. Countess) and given names. Honorifics were
unambiguous. Given name guesses were against the 1990 U.S. census; gender was guessed if the
frequency of the name occurring in one gender was at least four times that in the other. “Joseph” was
reliably guessed as predominantly male (1.404% male; 0.005% female) but “Pat” was considered
unknown (0.040% female to 0.022% male). In the case of the 18,495 subjects from Chambers, all but
1,210 (~7%) are assessed a gender via pronoun counts, and only 431 (2%) of subjects remain unknown
after name-based guesses.
To consider an example in full, Claudine Alexandrine Guérin de Tencin, (French novelist, socialite,
and mother of encyclopedist Jean le Rond d’Alembert), was selected from Chambers Biographical
Dictionary. This name was queried via Google against the English Wikipedia and Britannica websites.
Wikipedia’s article on “Claudine Guérin de Tencin” and Britannica’s article on “Claudine-Alexandrine Guerin
de Tencin” were returned as possible matches. The source name and both titles were then transformed by
lowercasing, removing hyphens and diacritics, and then sorting. After transformation, Wikipedia’s article
title (i.e., “claudine de guerin tencin”) and that of Britannica (i.e., “alexandrine claudine de guerin tencin”)
were considered appropriate matches against the source (i.e., “alexandrine claudine de guerin tencin”)

International Journal of Communication 5 (2011)

Gender Bias in Wikipedia and Brittanica 1143

because the words in both transformed titles are subsets of the transformed source name. The subject
was assessed as female, given that the Wikipedia article has 30 feminine pronouns (i.e., “her” and “she”)
and no masculine pronouns (i.e., “his” and “he”). The encyclopedic content of the Wikipedia article
includes 389 words to Britannica’s 196.
Wikipedia and Britannica each have a rare article variant that we include in the analysis. At
Wikipedia, similar subjects often have a “disambiguation page” that provides links to more specific
articles. For example, its article for “Mary Anderson” in the NWHP list is a disambiguation page that
includes links to nine biographies. If “(disambiguation)” is within the URL of the results returned by
Google, we skip this result, as the next result is possibly the appropriate biography. Yet, not all
disambiguation pages are identified via the URL. However, such biographical pages are tagged with the
{{dmbox}} or {{setindexbox}} templates, and we choose the first article listed. (Such disambiguation
pages are rare; they are encountered in only about 1% of the source lists we tested, for example, the
TIME, Atlantic, NWHP, and Wikipedia lists.) On the other hand, Britannica includes pages wherein a person
is related to, but not the subject of, a complete article. For example, the composer “Buffy Sainte-Marie”
has a very

short article

that is only

a paragraph excerpt from the “Billy

Williams

(British

cinematographer)” article. Hence, inclusion of these fragments may improve Britannica’s coverage figures,
but also may decrease article length figures. While Wikipedia does permit “targeted redirects” in which a
subject’s article may redirect to the section of another article (such as the “Malia Obama” article
redirecting to a section of the “Family of Barack Obama”), we never encountered an instance of this in
manually examined data (TIME, Atlantic and NWHP); if any occurred, the (theoretical) impact would be to
lessen Wikipedia’s coverage.
The data used in our analyses are available online (Reagle, 2010).
Findings
Biographical Coverage Analysis by Percentages
What kind of gender imbalance exists in biographical sources, and how do Wikipedia and
Britannica compare? We begin by looking at lists of biographical persons and the proportions of gender
balance in covered articles in Wikipedia and Britannica. We then focus on the missing articles to see if we
can discern what factors contribute to their absence.
Comparison of Gender Balance
The NWHP maintains short biographies of women of import. Some are historical, some
contemporary, some widely known (e.g., Susan B. Anthony), but many are not. Hence it provides a
diverse challenge to encyclopedic coverage. Out of an initial test selection of 174 subjects Wikipedia
lacked 23 biographical articles, much less than the 74 articles missing from Britannica. In September 2009
these results were posted and reviewed by interested Wikipedians who helped identify bugs in our source
lists and results. Also, within a day, the “WikiProject Gender Studies/Feminism Task Force” set about

1144 Joseph Reagle & Lauren Rhue

International Journal of Communication 5(2011)

providing biographies for those missing in the preliminary analysis (Wikipedia, 2009a). By November, 6 of
the 23 original missing biographies were at least started. As of June 2010, analysis of all 268 women
revealed 77 biographies were missing from Wikipedia and 155 entries from Britannica. (While the NWHP
data is consequently tainted, it makes no differences to our findings and is not included in the regression
analyses in any case.)
However, this might only indicate that Wikipedia coverage is greater than that of Britannica and
does not address whether Wikipedia biographies are disproportionately male focused. Yet, because
Wikipedia (and other reference works) are documenting a biased world, it can be difficult to settle upon a
figure for “normal” female representation. Repeating Limey’s (2010) query of biographical resources for
those born after 1909, we approximated his finding of 29.9% female coverage at the Gale Biographical
Resource Center with 28.7% of queried persons being female (i.e., 347,874 female; 865,068 male
biographies). Furthermore, we queried two other sources: Wilson’s Current Biography Illustrated (CBI)
yielded 24.5% female biographies (2,715 female; 8,350 male), and American National Biography Online
offered up 15% (289 female; 1,644 men).
In any case, a more detailed comparative exploration required actual lists of notable men and
women, as is the case in the following analyses.

Wikipedia

In 2006, The Atlantic enumerated its top 100 most influential figures in American history, all of
which had biographies in Wikipedia and Britannica. Women are 10% of this population. However, a
different list of contemporary influential people shows a significant increase in female representation.
TIME’s list of 2008’s most influential people includes 105 persons (sometimes people are recognized in
pairs), 24 of whom are female (see Table 1). However, since Wikipedia has almost perfect coverage of
these two sources (as seen in Table 2), there is little room for its coverage to deviate from these two
sources.
Therefore, we sought a larger collection of people that spanned a greater historical period. An
online version of Chambers Biographical Dictionary lists 18,495 names that can be used to generate
unique queries (e.g., not including collisions between those with the same name, but with ambiguous birth

International Journal of Communication 5 (2011)

dates). While this source list does contain relatively contemporary figures, including those who died in
2007, it also includes the whole breadth of history, and favors those born in the early 20th and the 19th
centuries (roughly 12,000 subjects). It shares many naming conventions with Britannica and also contains
a fair amount of Barons, Lords, Sirs, and Dames. Performing the analysis on the 18,495 entries, 2,257 are
surmised to be female, 15,775 as male, and the program could not determine the gender of 463 persons.
Females are 12% of the source population, 12% of the Wikipedia population, but only 10% of the
Britannica population.
Because Chambers focuses on the 18th and 19th centuries, we wondered if some of our findings
are influenced by this particular list or by the period in which the subjects lived. So, we looked for yet
another large source from which to take a sample. We obtained a list of 1,000 random persons from the
American National Biography Online (ANBO) and found that, with respect to imbalance, Wikipedia actually
fared much worse than Britannica, with only 14% of its coverage dedicated to females relative to
Britannica’s 19%. Interestingly, while Wikipedia had nearly twice the number of female biographies than
did Britannica (113 to 60), it had over two and a half times the number of male biographies (673 to 254).
Gender Percentages of Missing Articles
Given that Wikipedia and Britannica roughly follow the biases of existing works, one might
conclude that they do not contain much gender bias; however, we can extend the analysis by focusing
upon the gender balance of the missing articles.

The columns in Table 2 display the number and percentage of missing articles for each reference
work and gender combination. For example, in the second column, Wikipedia is missing 247 females from
Chambers, or 11% of Chambers’ female population. The missing rates for unidentified gender subjects are
generally high (and omitted from this table) because the gender identification relies upon the occurrences
of pronouns in an article, if it exists, and on name-based guesses.

1146 Joseph Reagle & Lauren Rhue

International Journal of Communication 5(2011)

Over all six source lists, Britannica misses 7,767 names, much more than Wikipedia’s 1,780
missing subjects. Also, Wikipedia consistently misses fewer biographies than does Britannica for each
source list, confirming that Wikipedia has more exhaustive coverage than does Britannica.
Wikipedia’s exceptional overall coverage does not address systematic differences in which
subjects are covered. Gender could influence which subjects are overlooked in both Wikipedia and
Britannica. Toward understanding potential gender bias, we examine missing articles for males and
females separately, and we find that Wikipedia and Britannica both cover women less comprehensively
than they do males. Of the 2,287 women in the source population, Wikipedia misses 364 females and
Britannica misses 1,397, 13% and 49%, respectively. Of the 17,594 men, Wikipedia misses 965 subjects
and Britannica misses 5,872 subjects, 5% and 33%, respectively. Although the absolute number of
missing men exceeds the number of missing women in each reference work, women fare worse in their
proportion of missing articles. Relative to men, across all source lists, women have a 2.6 (13/5) greater
odds of omission in Wikipedia and a 1.48 (49/33) greater odds of omission in Britannica.
Finally, how do these reference works compare when we use Wikipedia as a source? A list of
biographies from Wikipedia in 2007 included 445,966 subjects (Wikipedia, 2009e). Unlike other sources,
this included music bands. It also included pages that were listed as “(page does not exist).” Excluding
these two subjects, we randomly sampled 1,000 subjects and found that Britannica faired poorly, missing
914 entries. Wikipedia missed 14, meaning they’ve since been deleted, perhaps for lack of notability. Of
all the entries, 159 are female, 810 are male, and 31 are of unknown gender. That is, women are 16% of
the gender-known population of the Wikipedia list and its analyzed articles. Women comprise only 14% of
the Britannica articles.
Coverage Analysis via Logistic Regression
The preceding analysis of gender balance reveals that the reference works have more
comprehensive coverage of male biographies. To better isolate the correlation between subject gender
and coverage, if any, we analyze the relationship between subject coverage and reference work, gender,
and source list. The dependent variable is Coverage, which is coded as 1 if a subject’s biography is
included in the reference work and as 0 if the subject is missing. There are four independent variables
related to gender: Male, Unknown Gender, Male in Wikipedia, and Unknown in Wikipedia. Male and
Unknown Gender are indicator variables: Male is coded as 1 for male subjects and as 0 for other subjects,
and Unknown Gender is coded as 1 for unknown gender subjects and as 0 otherwise. Females are coded
as 0 for Male and Unknown Gender. With this specification, the coefficient on the Male variable becomes a
comparison in the relative change in coverage for male subjects relative to female subjects. Based on
earlier analysis, our hypothesis is that men receive better coverage than women, so the Male coefficient is
expected to be positive, indicating a correlation between male subjects and increased coverage.
The effect of gender may not be consistent across both reference works. For example, Britannica
has more comprehensive coverage of men than it does of women from most source lists, but it also has
better coverage of women from ANBO. To identify the interaction between gender and reference work, the

International Journal of Communication 5 (2011)

Gender Bias in Wikipedia and Brittanica 1147

model includes another independent variable: Male in Wikipedia, which is coded as 1 for a male subject in
a Wikipedia entry and as 0 otherwise. The Male in Wikipedia coefficient estimates the effect of gender for
subjects in Wikipedia as distinct from either Wikipedia’s overall coverage or from gender bias in reference
works. The Unknown in Wikipedia is coded similarly and included for control purposes.
We used logistic regression to estimate the effects of the independent variables on Coverage. We
restricted the regression dataset to names from TIME, The Atlantic, the 1,000 ANBO random samples, and
a random sample of 1,000 subjects from Chambers. We sampled from our larger Chambers dataset to
prevent idiosyncrasies in Chambers from dominating the regression results. The effect of gender is
stronger using the entire set of names from Chambers, possibly due to the historical nature of the
biographies. We attempted to control for historical period by gathering birth/death years for subjects;
however, accurate period information was missing for more than 3,000 subjects, so those controls were
not included in the regression. The sample of 1,000 names was chosen from the Chambers source to
match the number of names from the ANBO source. NWHP was excluded because it is composed of only
female names, precluding comparison between the coverage of men and women. Wikipedia as a source of
names was omitted because the coverage is naturally skewed toward Wikipedia and could confound
analysis of gender bias. The revised dataset for empirical analysis contains 2,205 subjects with 333
females, 1,824 males, and 48 subjects without an identifiable gender.
The three source list variables are included to control for differences among the source lists.
There are variables for three of the four source lists in the dataset: Chambers, ANBO, and TIME. For
example, the TIME variable is coded as 1 for every name that originates from the TIME source list and as
0 otherwise. Subjects from The Atlantic are coded as 0 for the three source list variables, allowing for a
comparison between the coverage rates for the other source lists and The Atlantic. Because Wikipedia and
Britannica contain all except one name from The Atlantic, the coefficients on the source list variables are
all expected to be negative.
Finally, the independent variable Wikipedia is coded as 1 if the biography is from Wikipedia and
as 0 if from Britannica. Thus, the Wikipedia coefficient indicates Wikipedia’s coverage relative to that of
Britannica. We expect a positive coefficient on Wikipedia to confirm the earlier analysis.
Comparison of Britannica and Wikipedia Bias
These regression results support many of our earlier findings. Wikipedia’s superior coverage,
regardless of gender, is highlighted in the significant positive coefficient on Wikipedia. Furthermore, the
negative coefficients on Chambers, TIME, and ANBO confirm that both reference works are missing more
subjects from these source lists than they are from The Atlantic, the baseline.

Interestingly, two of the gender variables, Male and Unknown, have non-significant coefficients,
suggesting that the influence of gender may not be consistent across both reference works. In contrast,
the Male in Wikipedia coefficient is significant, providing evidence that gender contributes to the subject’s
degree of coverage on Wikipedia. This finding supports the earlier result that Wikipedia’s female missing
rates were consistently higher across source lists than were those of males.
The logistic regression results allow us to ascertain the probabilities of a subject’s coverage based
on the source list of the names, the subject’s gender, and the reference work. The probability of a
subject’s coverage is given by the inverse logit of the sum of the coefficients and attributes. For example,
to find the probability of Wikipedia covering a man from the Chambers source list, we first assign values to
his attributes: 1 for Male, 1 for Wikipedia, 1 for Chambers, 1 for Male in Wikipedia, and 0 for all other
variables. Then we use the significant coefficients in the regression results to assess the probability of
inclusion:

5.4119*0+0.5522*1)) = 95%. The expected 95% coverage rate aligns with the empirical coverage rates
shown in Table 2, which shows that for Chambers, Wikipedia misses 5% of its males.

Gender Bias in Wikipedia and Brittanica 1149

To assess the goodness-of-fit,2 we use a likelihood ratio test to compare the deviance of our
model to the deviance of the model without any variables, or the null deviance. The difference between
the null deviance and the residual deviance, 1422, is evaluated according to a chi-squared distribution
with 6 degrees of freedom. Because the difference of 1422 is larger than the critical value of 16.81, the
model fits the data reasonably well.
The finding of this analysis is contingent on a couple of factors. First, these results are dependent
upon data gathered from the Web and on our approaches to determining whether an article exists, and if
it does, its word length and gender. These approaches and our assessment of their reliability are described
in the Methods section. To assess the effect of the subjects with unidentified gender on the findings noted
previously, we reran the model, classifying all the unidentified subjects as male and then as female. Our
results are similar, suggesting that the inclusion of the unknown gender does not influence the findings.
Second, this reduced-form model identifies a correlation between gender and coverage, but cannot
establish causation. If a correlation exists between gender and an unobserved variable like time period,
then our results would indicate gender bias. For example, if the men in a listing were from the 20th
century and the women from the 19th century, then the differences in coverage could be caused by
Wikipedia’s strength on current noteworthy figures, but the results would identify a link between men and
better coverage. We investigated this possibility in the Chambers data and reran the regressions with
controls for the historical era of the subjects and still found a significant gender bias in Wikipedia coverage
that is absent in Britannica. We therefore believe that our findings are robust to alternative explanations.
Article Length Analysis
For our source lists of biographies, Wikipedia has greater female biographical coverage than does
Britannica in absolute terms. However, we have also found that articles on women are more likely to be
missing than are articles on men in Wikipedia relative to Britannica. What happens when we go beyond
article coverage and consider article length?
A small number of subjects are covered with extremely long articles, leading to a highly rightskewed distribution of the article length. To offset the large outliers, like the extensive article on Jesus in
Britannica, we compare the medians of article lengths between Wikipedia and Britannica.

Wikipedia

As shown in Table 4, Wikipedia articles are consistently larger than those of Britannica across all
source lists. The median article length in Wikipedia ranges from 88% longer to 600% longer than that of
Britannica for same-gender, same-source subjects. The longest articles in both Wikipedia and Britannica
are for subjects from The Atlantic, an expected result because those names constitute an attempt to
identify the 100 most influential people. Interestingly, no consistent difference in article length exists
between males and females. For example, the median number of words in Wikipedia articles on female
subjects from Chambers is higher than that for male subjects. At Britannica, median article lengths for
men are larger for biographies from The Atlantic and TIME, but not for the others. Therefore, the median
analysis does not imply a consistent relationship between article length and gender.

Comparison of Wikipedia and Britannica Bias
We can also use a regression to test the relationship between gender and the article length. The
dependent variable is the number of words per article. The independent variables are similar to those in
the coverage analysis: Male, Chambers, ANBO, TIME, Wikipedia, and Male in Wikipedia. These variables
control for differences among the source lists, but the analysis is primarily focused on the Male in
Wikipedia coefficient.
The dataset for the article length analysis is subject to the same restrictions as is the one used
for the earlier logistic regression—a reduced sample of names from Chambers and exclusion of names
from the NWHP and Wikipedia source lists. In addition, subjects missing from one or both works are
eliminated from the data to reduce any bias towards Wikipedia’s better coverage. The new data contain
1,142 subjects from the four lists with 158 female subjects and 984 male subjects. There are no subjects
with unknown gender, so that variable is dropped from the analysis.
Quantile regression is used to estimate the effects of gender bias at different places in the article
length distribution. Longer articles could indicate subjects with more societal importance, and the
treatment of noteworthy figures may systematically differ by gender. For example, biographies of lower
profile subjects with a lower word count may be similar in length irrespective of gender. Longer articles,
covering high profile subjects, may differ in length systematically by gender. Quantile regression would
uncover these differences in the relationship between article length and gender. For this reason, quantile
regression is more robust to the large outliers present in the distribution. Based on the median analysis,
we would not expect a systematic gender difference in article length at the median (50th quantile).

Figure 2 depicts the Male in Wikipedia coefficient estimates and standard errors for quantile
regressions on each decile of the article length. Similar to the preceding section, the Male in Wikipedia
coefficient measures the relative increase or decrease in words associated with being a male subject in a
Wikipedia entry. The coefficient is significant for only 6th and 7th deciles; however, there is no significant
effect in the lower or higher quantiles of the distribution.
Although not the primary focus, the source list coefficients are significant for each decile and
confirmed our earlier findings about differences in median article length among different source lists. The
Male coefficient is significant for the 2nd quantile with p-values of p < 0.05, but it is not significant at
other deciles. The Wikipedia coefficient is significant across all deciles, confirming that Wikipedia articles
are consistently longer than are Britannica articles.
The quantile regression results are not conclusive to gender bias in Wikipedia or Britannica’s
article lengths. The gender variables’ coefficients are not significant for the majority of the deciles,
including the extremes. There is not a straightforward explanation for the significant increase of male
article length for the 6th and 7th deciles, but there are alternative explanations to gender bias in
Wikipedia. Perhaps many of the moderately noteworthy figures share a common unobserved element, like
being professional athletes who naturally skew male. Without more definite results or the ability to
eliminate the alternative explanations, gender bias can be only one possible explanation for the significant
difference at the 6th and 7th deciles on the Male in Wikipedia coefficient and at the 2nd decile of the Male
coefficient.
Limitations and Further Research
The present work is limited in that it takes place in a sociohistorical context of existing bias.
Hence, the presented method is a comparison of Wikipedia coverage relative to specific sources for
biographies and to Britannica’s coverage. Also, this work is wholly focused on article coverage and length;
we do not speak to the character or quality of article content. While we were motivated by reports of
gender imbalance in contributors, this study does not address a causal relationship between contributors
and content. First, we do not know the gender balance of contributors to other lists and works. (And what
we know of Wikipedia is based on surveys. Anecdotally, a participant in the Wikipedia Feminism Task
Force noted that most of their articles are not written by women.) Second, other factors such as preexisting historical bias are present and may be dominant. Even so, with respect to quality, one possible
avenue open to the present method would be to look at coverage according to Wikipedia-designated
quality categories, for example, “featured” and “good” articles (Wikipedia, 2009b). Finally, it would be
useful to repeat the last analysis—where we tested Britannica against a sample of all Wikipedia
biographies—using Britannica, if a sample of all online Britannica biographic articles could be obtained.

Conclusion
Our efforts to collect and compare data across thousands of articles at Wikipedia and Britannica
permit us to report a number of novel findings. First, with respect to article coverage and length, we
conclude that Wikipedia has significantly greater coverage than does Britannica because the percent of
missing articles is higher for Britannica than it is for Wikipedia; Britannica has only about 10% of the
articles from a random sample of Wikipedia biographies (Table 2). Also, Wikipedia articles are significantly
longer than Britannica articles (Table 4). The median article length for Wikipedia is larger than that of
Britannica for every source list.
Second, we take a couple of approaches in attempting to describe and compare gender
imbalances in biographical coverage, each with their own finding. In looking at the gender imbalance in
listings of notable persons, queries to three large comprehensive biographical databases yield 15%,
24.5%, and 28.7% female coverage. From the biographical source lists we used, it seems that
contemporary lists of notable persons are more likely to have more women than are older lists or those
with more historic figures. With respect to the percentage of women in a reference work, Wikipedia and
Britannica both roughly mirror the bias of the source list, with Wikipedia performing slightly better than
does Britannica in most cases (Table 1). While Wikipedia has more biographies of women than does
Britannica in absolute terms (Table 1), Wikipedia tends to be less balanced in whom it misses than is
Britannica as seen in the percentages of missing articles (Table 2) and the positive and significant Male
coefficient in the logistic regression (Table 3). However, gender is inconsistently correlated with article
length (Figure 2). Although the coefficients on male subjects are significantly different from zero for
certain deciles in the article length distribution, gender does not influence article length in the majority of
deciles, suggesting that gender bias may not be a strong factor for article length. That is, if a subject is
deemed notable enough to warrant inclusion in Wikipedia and Britannica, then the subjects, regardless of
gender, may be treated similarly by the contributors.
Overall, we find evidence of gender bias in Wikipedia coverage of biographies. While Wikipedia’s
massive reach in coverage means one is more likely to find a biography of a woman there than in
Britannica, evidence of gender bias surfaces from a deeper analysis of those articles each reference work
misses. That Wikipedia’s missing articles are disproportionately female relative to those of Britannica is
seen in a comparison of the ratio of female to male subjects in each work and in the related logistic
regression.
