2-10). Testing rates were lower in the unvaccinated group. In January 2021, for example, there were
933 tests per 10,000 person-days among the unvaccinated group, compared with 1167 among the
partially vaccinated group (> 14 days after first dose until receipt of second dose) and 2018 among
the fully vaccinated group (> 14 days after second dose). The rate of testing decreased from 957
tests per 10,000 person-days in January to 886 in February.

Confirmed infections and other COVID-19 outcomes
A total of 13,216 confirmed infections (37.8 per 10,000 person-days), 393 hospitalizations (1.1
per 10,000 person-days), and 48 deaths (0.1 per 10,000 person-days) were documented among co-

 

hort members. Most of these outcomes occurred among unvaccinated people (Table [?]). Incidence
of confirmed infection was 0.6 per 10,000 person-days among the fully vaccinated, 3.5 among the
partially vaccinated, and 46.8 among the unvaccinated. Incidence of infection decreased during the

study period, from 40.2 per 10,000 person-days in January 2021 to 11.8 in February (Figure [?]).

Vaccine effectiveness

There was no significant difference in the adjusted hazard ratio for confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in-
fection during days 0 to 6 days after receiving a first dose relative to unvaccinated status (Table
[?]). From 7 to 13 days after a first dose, estimated vaccine effectiveness was 44% (95% CI, 20-61%),
and from 14 days after a first dose until receipt of a second dose, effectiveness was 74% (95% CI,
64-82%). Effectiveness estimates were 85% (95% CI, 66-94%) from 0 to 13 days after a second dose
and 97% (95% CI, 88-99%) from 14 days after a second dose.

Secondary analyses

Subgroup analyses produced similar estimates of effectiveness to the full cohort analysis (Table
S3A). Among those receiving the mRNA-1273 vaccine, estimated effectiveness was 71% (95% CI,
58-80%) from 14 days after first dose until receipt of second dose and 96% (95% CI, 67-99%) from
14 days after second dose. Among cohort members at moderate or high risk for severe COVID-19
illness, effectiveness estimates were 74% (95% CI, 62-82%) from 14 days after first dose until receipt
of second dose and 92% (95% CI, 74-98%) from 14 days after second dose.

Estimates in an expanded cohort that included new entrants and residents with prior infections
did not differ appreciably from the main cohort analysis. Results were also insensitive to model
specification choices, including censoring of observation time at the date of cohort members’ last
test and clustering standard errors at different residential levels.

In secondary analyses that modified the study end date, effectiveness estimates for fully vacci-
nated residents (i-e., from 14 days after second dose) decreased from 98% (95% CI, 82-100%) to 82%
(95% CI, 69-89%) over a series of end dates between February 15 and July 1, 2021. Study months

spanning March to July were characterized by significantly lower outbreak risks across all facilities

“reference” probes (control probes with a fixed fluorescence value that control for the geometry and
preparation of the array), by applying batch normalization using ComBat[120], and by correcting for
observed covariates (gender, age, and collection site) using robust linear regression. The residuals
after these corrections were then used as the gene expression values for downstream analyses. Pre-
viously to these corrections, the data was log-transformed to better resemble a normal distribution.
Differential expression analysis was performed using the Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM)
[110]. Genes shown in Figure 3.1B had the highest gene expression difference and were deemed sig-
nificantly up or down regulated with a false discovery rate of 5%. QQ plots for differential expression

are shown in Figure 3.2.

Co-expression networks

We ran the following methods on the covariate-corrected data described in the section above using
the top 40% most variable genes (n=7960) and on each cohort separately, except in the case of the
joint graphical LASSO (see below).

e WGCNA: We ran the WGCNA pipeline including correlation matrix, TOM transformation,

and Dynamic Tree Cut module finding as prescribed 19 on each network separately.

e Pearson correlation: We obtained the empirical Pearson correlation matrix and performed an

absolute correlation coefficient cutoff of abs(R) > 0.6.

e ARACNe: We ran the method with default parameters and 500 bootstrap iterations for cal-

culating significant gene co-expression relationships.

e Z-score: Otherwise known as the CLR method, we ran the method using the Pearson correla-
tion matrix as input. The output is then a statistical scoring of each interaction for genes A

and B considering all interactions of A and B against each other gene.

e Joint graphical LASSO (JGL): The JGL has two main parameters — a sparsity penalty to tune
how many interactions are found and a group penalty that tries to match the network structure
of the two cohorts. We performed a grid search on these parameters and chose the one that
maximized the Akaike Information Criterion. This resulted in a very low group penalty of
0.01 and a modicum sparsity penalty of 0.1, which was applied to a standardized matrix of

expression values for both cohorts.

eQTL discovery

Prior to eQTL discovery, we used PEER to find hidden covariates that could confound signals in our
data as well as filtering any genotypes with major allele frequencies less than 5%. To test associations

between gene expression in each cohort separately, we used QTLTools/[48] with an additive model

(Figure 1.6). Most of these acceptances were in response to a first re-offer. The proportion of
re-offers that were accepted decreased with each subsequent re-offer.

Adjusted analyses of acceptance among re-offerees did not show significant differences according
to race or ethnic groups. However, younger and healthier re-offerees were more likely to accept.
Specifically, re-offerees aged 18 to 39 years (47.6%; 95% CI, 43-52.3%) or 40 to 64 years (48.7%; 95%
CI, 44.1-53.2%) were more likely to accept than re-offerees aged 65 years or older (33.4%; 95% CI,
24.3-42.5%). Similarly, re-offerees with low (49.3%; 95% CI, 45.3-53.3%) or medium (47.3%; 95%
CI, 40.9-53.6%) Covid-19 risk scores were more likely to accept than re-offerees with high Covid-19
risk scores (38.1%; 95% CI, 31.1-45.1%).

Sensitivity Analysis Separate analyses for male and female offerees showed similar results, with
two notable exceptions. Among female offerees, Hispanic women and women with prior Covid-19

infection were less likely to accept than White women and those with no prior infection, respectively.

Discussion

This study of vaccine acceptance among residents of California state prisons found that two thirds
of those offered vaccines accepted at least one dose. Acceptance was relatively low among non-
Hispanic minorities, especially Black residents and residents at lower risk of severe illness from
Covid-19. However, nearly half of residents who were re-offered a first vaccine dose after initially
declining accepted it.

Calculating levels and patterns of vaccine acceptance in the general community is currently chal-
lenging for several reasons. Denominators for acceptance rates are elusive as eligibility rules change
and people queue for appointments. Many eligible people may not get vaccinated because they are
unaware of their eligibility or face access barriers rather than being truly reluctant. In addition,
important information on who has been vaccinated, including race and ethnicity, is incomplete [26].
Studying acceptance in circumscribed settings, such as prisons, mitigates these challenges.

Long-term care facilities are also circumscribed settings and provide a relevant comparator. A
recent study of 12,702 skilled nursing facilities enrolled in the Pharmacy Partnership for Long-Term
Care Program found that the median estimated percentage of residents vaccinated per facility was
77.8% [58, 59]. Although this is more than 10 percentage points higher than the overall acceptance
levels in the incarcerated population we studied, it is quite close to the acceptance levels we observed
among older and more medically vulnerable residents.

The substantially lower acceptance observed among Black, younger, and healthier offerees is
consistent with both survey evidence of willingness to obtain vaccination [7, 99, 57] and preliminary
data on vaccine uptake in the general community [3]. Greater reluctance among those at lower
tisk of severe disease is predictable, but in congregate settings, where transmission risks and herd

immunity thresholds are high [102], low vaccination rates in any subgroup ensure continuing risks.

3.1 Gene network rewiring in heart failure

3.1.1 Introduction

Heart failure (HF) is a life-threatening syndrome characterized by an inability of the heart to meet
the metabolic demands of the body. HF costs the US more than $34 billion a year to treat 6 million
patients[79, 52]. Despite this, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood and
the few approved therapeutics target maladaptive compensatory pathology rather than proximate
molecular mechanisms[111, 97].

With rapidly increasing access to high throughput sequencing technology, molecular characteri-
zation of human heart tissue has become possible, and in recent years a number of efforts to define
the regulatory transcriptional architecture of HF in humans and small animals have been under-
taken [39, 81, 67, 121, 66, 64, 70, 94]. These efforts have revealed changes in gene expression of key
sarcomeric, calcium cycling, developmental and metabolic genes. Because of the significant logistical
challenge of harvesting healthy hearts, few studies have included a non-failing control group, mak-
ing conclusions regarding the transition to HF tentative. Further, as gene expression programs are
rapidly altered in an environment of high oxidative and nitrosative stress [93], the high metabolic
rate of the heart limits the utility of post-mortem tissue for gene expression analysis (e.g., from
public resources such as GTEx [61, 88, 62]).

Thus, the expansion of this resource with high fidelity tissue collection and molecular charac-
terization is required, and a crucial next step in synthesizing this information is the identification,
and in vitro and in vivo validation, of novel molecular actors in this disease. In this study, we
identify previously undetected cardiac expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLS) from genome-wide
genotyping and gene expression measurements from rapidly preserved failing and non-failing human

heart tissue.

Phenylephrine or vehicle treatment started at 48 hours. RNA was collected at 36, 48, 72 and 96
hours after isolation. (B) Clustered heat map of NRVM transcriptional expression of central coor-
dinators in response to PPP1R3A knockdown (measured by RNAseq). Expression is shown from
NRVMs at 72 and 96 hours after isolation normalized to pre-treatment expression, and displayed
as per-gene z-scores. Data from cells with and without phenylephrine (PE) are shown on the left
and right sides of the heat map with and without siRNA knockdown as indicated. Stars indi-
cate central coordinators significantly differentially regulated by PPP1R3a knockdown (FDRj0.05,
red stars indicate significance in the PE treated group (red at 72 hours, dark red at 96 hours)
and blue stars indicate significance in the untreated group after PPP1R3a knockdown at 72 (light

lus of phenylephrine treatment. Upper Panel: Cell size measurements of a sample of cells under
phenylephrine and normal conditions, with and without PPP1R3a KD reveal reduced hypertrophy
in NRVMs treated with PE and PPP1R3a KD compared to PE treated cells with and without
scramble siRNA transfection (p < lel0~* (ANOVA), *=p < 1e10~3 by Bonferroni posttest. n=100
cells for each group, Red bars indicate mean, black bars indicate one standard deviation). Lower
panel: MYH7/MYH6 ratio, a marker for HF, is decreased in PPP1R3a knockdown NRVMs treated
with PE compared to those transfected with scrambled siRNA control at 72 hours and 96 hours af-
ter isolation (p < 1e10~ 2 for both comparisons, error bars represent 95% confidence intervals). (D)
Respiratory pyruvate metabolism increases after PPP1R3A knockdown. Knockdown of PPP1IR3A
leads to increased basal and maximal respiratory metabolism of pyruvate as measured by oxygen
consumption in NRVM (basal respiration: p=0.02, maximal respiration: p=0.005, center line in-
dicates median, box indicates IQR, and whiskers indicate next adjacent value. n= 3 biologically

Figure 1.4: Cumulative offers of Covid-19 vaccinations to residents of California state prisons, De-
cember 22, 2020, through March 4, 2021.

Adjusted analyses estimated similar levels of acceptance of one or more doses among offerees
who did (67.4%; CI, 66.3-68.4%) and did not (66.2%; CI, 65.6-66.8%) have prior SARS-CoV-2
infection (Figure 1.5). But there was wide variation in acceptance according to race or ethnic
group. Acceptance was highest among Hispanic offerees (72.4%; CI, 71.7-73.1%) and White offerees
(71.9%; CI, 70.7-73.1%). Acceptance was slightly lower among American Indian/Alaska Native
offerees (67.5%; CI, 62.6-72.3%) and Asian/Pacific Islander offerees (67.5%; CI, 63.3-71.8%), and
substantially lower among Black offerees (54.7%; 99.6% Confidence Interval, 53.8-55.7%).

Acceptance was positively associated with older age and higher Covid-19 risk score. Offerees
aged 18 to 39 years (58.0%; CI, 57.2-58.8%) and 40 to 64 years (73.4%; CI, 72.6-74.1%) were less
likely to accept a vaccine dose than offerees aged 65 years or older (84.5%; CI, 82.6-86.4%). Offerees
with low (61.6%; CI, 60.9-62.2%) and medium (74.0%; CI, 72.9-75.1%) Covid-19 risk scores were less
likely to accept a vaccine dose than offerees with high Covid-19 risk scores (82.5%; CI, 81.1-83.9%).

The race and ethnic disparities reported above were very consistent across Covid-19 risk score
and age groups, such that acceptance levels among Black offerees with high Covid-19 risk scores were
similar to those among White and Hispanic offerees with low Covid-19 risk scores and American
Indian/Alaska Native and Asian/Pacific Islander offerees with moderate Covid-19 risk scores (Figure
$1). Acceptance levels among Black offerees in the youngest age group and Black offerees with low
Covid-19 risk scores were below 50%.

Vaccine Acceptance among Initial Decliners Overall, 8.7% (1,962/22,582) of residents who de-

 

clined a first dose offer received at least one re-offer; 45.9% (901/1,962) of those re-offerees accepted

the transition from healthy to failing myocardium.

3.1.4 Discussion

We have constructed a comprehensive gene regulatory map of human heart failure (HF). This effort
has been facilitated by a systematic approach to the collection of control and failing heart tissue from
the operating rooms of cardiac transplant centers and the resulting measurements have allowed us to
describe several previously unrecognized molecular features of HF. Notably, the network structure
of HF differs markedly from that of non-failing heart tissue. Specifically, we find that the control
network has a large number of genes (2614) not associated with modules, whereas in the HF net-
work, only 13 genes remained unassociated, providing evidence for increased connectivity in the HF
network. Further, in the HF network, there is significant rewiring of genes to new processes (Figure
3.6C), and an array of changes in co-expression relationships of central genes to key processes such
as sarcomeric structure, excitation-contraction coupling, metabolism, and cardiac remodeling.

The inferred networks also aided in the discovery of new eQTLs in the non-failing and failing
contexts. Notably, we found a greater number of eQTLs in the failing heart, half of which were not
previously reported, but that were still implicated in higher phenotype associations in GWAS. In
some cases, the expression of local subnetworks of genes were found to be associated with one locus,
such as several members of the TAS2R G protein coupled receptor family, receptors typically asso-
ciated with the sensation of taste but recently found to be variously expressed in cardiac tissue.[55]
Further, these eQTLs were enriched for regulatory annotations, which were more prevalent in the
failing heart cohort. Thus, these newly identified eQTLs are not only important for identifying po-
tential regulatory DNA, but also novel molecular actors in HF that would not have been discovered
in healthy tissue alone.

In addition to identified eQTLs, comparison of co-expression structure between disease and con-
trol networks highlighted genes whose connectivity changed meaningfully between the two cohorts,
regardless of change in mean expression. This reveals central coordinating genes in HF that would
otherwise be missed by examination of individual gene expression alone. This phenomenon has been
observed across human diseases,[75, 129] and highlights a critical feature of co-expression networks:
they capture the global complexity of regulation beyond individual changes in expression to identify
genes pivotal in disease. Here, our strategy classified genes both by their local connectivity and their
network distance to HF-relevant pathways (global connectivity) to identify PPP1R3A as a gene with
a putative role in HF. PPP1R3A would not have been identified without this network approach,
given that its own expression is not altered drastically in disease. Subsequent molecular investiga-
tions demonstrated its effect on other central coordinators between the control and HF networks
as well as a deleterious effect on contractile function in the setting of pressure overload in vivo.
Although this gene has not previously been associated with human cardiac disease, studies in both

mouse and human have found that loss-of-function mutations in PPP1R3A manipulate metabolic

variables were assigned their values on the date of the offeree’s first offer.

A secondary analysis focused on re-offerees followed the same general form as the primary anal-
ysis, except the analytic sample was restricted to re-offerees. The outcome variable distinguished
re-offerees who accepted > 1 subsequent offer from those who did not. We report predicted margins
from all analyses.

Our analyses did not adjust for sex because male and female residents were housed in separate
prisons, making a sex variable perfectly collinear with the prison fixed effects. To test the robustness
of our main results to this omission, we re-ran the primary analysis separately for male and female
offerees. Additional details regarding model and variable specifications are provided in section II of
the Supplementary Appendix.

Analyses were performed using R software, version 3.5.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Comput-
ing). We performed post hoc Bonferroni correction for the primary and secondary outcomes to
account for multiple comparisons (14 for each of the primary and secondary analyses) by estimating

99.6% confidence intervals instead of 95% confidence intervals.

Results

Vaccine Offers A total of 97,779 people spent at least one night in a CDCR prison during the study
period. CDCR’s vaccine program scaled up quickly, with 8% of residents offered at least one vaccine
by the end of the first month, 37% by 6 weeks, and 60.1% by 2 months (Figure 1.4). By March 4,
2021, CDCR had offered 66.1% (64,633/97,779) of residents a first dose and 23.9% (23,413/97,779)
first and second doses.

Characteristics of Vaccine Offerees Most of the 64,633 offerees in our sample were male (95.6%),
younger than 65 years (92.0%), and Hispanic (42.0%) or Black (31.7%). Approximately one quarter
of offerees participated in penal labor (28.8%), lived in dormitories (25.8%), and had a prior SARS-
CoV-2 infection (27.8%).

A substantial proportion of offerees were at risk for severe outcomes from Covid-19 infection.
One third had medium or high Covid-19 risk scores, and more than half had at least one medical
condition linked to increased risk of severe Covid-19-related illness. The most common pre-existing
conditions were obesity or severe obesity (40.7%), chronic kidney disease (16.1%), diabetes (9.2%),
and cardiovascular disease (4.5%).

Vaccine Acceptance Two thirds of offerees (42,952/64,633) accepted one or both doses. The
proportion who accepted was very similar among male (66.6%; 41,145/61,820) and female (64.2%;
1,807/2,813) offerees.

The proportion of offerees that accepted a first dose decreased during the study period, from
77.2% in the first month to 63.6% in the last month. Among residents who accepted a first dose
and were offered a second, 98.7% accepted; this proportion increased from 89.1% in the first month

to 98.7% in the last month.

CHAPTER 1. EQUITY IN HEALTH POLICIES 16

The considerable vaccine hesitancy we observed among Black residents is particularly troubling. One
plausible explanation is mistrust [95]. The adverse effects of historical exploitation and persistent
disparities in medical care on minorities’ trust in providers and care seeking behaviors have been
well documented [23, 73, 104, 36, 101]. Medical mistrust appears to be particularly high among
African American men [23, 32, 30].

Hispanic offerees in our sample had similar levels of vaccine acceptance to white offerees. This
finding matches results from survey research in the general community regarding intentions to obtain
a Covid-19 vaccine [89], but conflicts with growing evidence of relatively low uptake among Hispanics
[3, 106]. Lower access barriers in prisons than in the general community may explain the discrepancy.

Our finding that a large proportion of residents who initially declined a first-dose offer later
accepted a re-offer indicates that hesitancy is not always fixed. Younger and healthier residents
were especially likely to switch. Why residents switched is not clear. As the number of vaccinated
co-residents climbed, peer pressure may have played a role; so might the reassurance of witnessing
no ill effects among vaccinated co-residents. Regardless, these results suggest re-offers have real
potential to boost vaccine coverage.

This study has several limitations. First, we report levels and patterns of hesitancy in the first
10 weeks of CDCR’s program; these statistics may change as the number of vaccinated residents
grows, knowledge improves, and vaccine options expand. CDCR began offering Johnson & Johnson’s
one-dose vaccine after our study period ended. Relatedly, the results reflect offers made to a non-
random selection of residents, many of whom were prioritized based on risk factors for severe disease.
Acceptance levels are likely to be lower in the remaining one third of residents, who generally have
lower risk. Second, results from our re-offer analyses should be interpreted with caution because a
majority of those who declined had not received re-offers at the time of our data extract, and those
to whom re-offers were made were not selected systematically. Third, residents’ peer interactions
are likely to have had a strong bearing on their propensity to accept vaccine offers; although we
adjusted for prisons and room size, we did not measure those finer environmental influences. Fourth,
we did not have access to detailed information on the procedures by which vaccine offers were made
at each prison nor why residents declined. Finally, the generalizability of our results to other prisons
or non-incarcerated populations is unknown.

Correctional settings are high-risk settings for Covid-19-related spread, morbidity, and mortality.
More incarcerated people have died from Covid-19 in U.S. correctional facilities in the last year than
died by capital punishment in the last 70 years [58, 53, 13]. Vaccines are a critical means for
controlling these risks. The substantial degree of vaccine uptake in California prisons promises
major preventive health benefits. Even greater benefits will accrue if the vaccination program can
be buttressed with successful efforts to build trust and reduce hesitancy, particularly among non-

Hispanic minorities and younger residents.

CHAPTER 3. METHODS IN PRECISION HEALTH 45

We then manually curated modules of genes related to four key processes involved in HF (Figure
3.6B: sarcomeric and contraction genes (orange), excitation-contraction (EC) coupling (red), cardiac
remodeling (green), and metabolism (blue)). Network connectivity changed within these process-
based modules between non-failing and failing networks. Compared to the non-failing network (grey
typeface), the failing heart network (red typeface) saw a general rewiring in connectivity within and
between these modules; metabolic genes gained a few specific genes such as the protein phosphatase
1 catalytic and regulatory subunits (PPP1CC, PPP1RI1A, and PPP1R3A/B/C) and the muscle
6-phosphofructokinase PFKM in the HF network (Figure 3.6B, blue). Cardiac remodeling genes
that gained connectivity were MYBPC3, MYH7, RYR2, and SGCG/D; Sarcomeric and contraction
genes that gained connectivity were MYBPC3, MYH/7, again listed due to pathway overlaps and
VIM, UQCRH/C1; while for EC coupling these were ATP1A1/2/3 and again RYR2.

Finally, plotting a Sankey diagram to observe where module membership changes from controls to
HF (Figure 3.6C) revealed large rewiring of co-expression structure. Shared core structure modules
such as electron transport chain (ETC) and metabolism genes mostly remained in the same module
(dark red in controls and turquoise in HF), while the unassigned genes in the controls (grey) went
mostly to the metabolism/ETC (turquoise), cell surface/immune/metabolism (brown), and fibrosis
(red) modules in HF.

High quality tissue expression data reveal cardiac eQTLs

We then leveraged genome-wide genotypes to find gene-expression-controlling loci (eQTLs) in each
cohort. First, we performed hidden covariate correction using the PEER package (see Methods).
We used QTLtools to perform association testing for each cohort separately (see Methods) and
performed a scan on the number of hidden factors to correct with PEER [114]. We found that
the HF cohort had more associated eQTLs than the control group (1566 vs 936, respectively, with
an overlap of 254 loci between the two groups, see http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2617028 for full
eQTL results); as expected these eQTLs showed proximity to known transcription factor binding
sites and transcription start sites (Figures 3.7A and B). We then tested these eQTLs for enrichment
of regulatory associations using RegulomeDB, a database of known and predicted regulatory regions
of the genome [33]. Here, both cohorts had several eQTLs with adjacent (within 50 base pair
window) regulatory annotation (716/1566 [46%] and 425/936 [45%] of variants, for failing vs control,
respectively) and/or predicted for transcription factor binding (Figure 3.2A). We then compared
our eQTLs with those found by the GTEx project. Our set of eQTLs contained hundreds of novel
associations when compared to the GTEx database for left ventricular tissue: 831/1566 [53% novel
associations] for the HF group and 423/936 [45% novel associations] for the control group (Figure
3.7C). We also identified significant overlap with specific tissue types (e.g. artery vs muscle) and

cell types (e.g. cultured fibroblasts) (Figure 3.2B).

CHAPTER 3. METHODS IN PRECISION HEALTH 48

within these associations by finding non-trivial connected components (i.e. with more than 3 nodes)
within the bipartite association graph of variants and genes, including WGCNA edges with weights
larger than the median (Figure 3.7D). Notably, we found two eQTLs within a region enriched with
predicted histone modifications that controlled a network of several TAS2R members in cis, a family
of G protein-coupled receptors, in both failing and control groups (Figure 3.7E-F, 110492099 and
184763223). As TAS2R receptors can have high homology in some regions, we checked for potential
probe cross-hybridization. We compared sequences for all TAS2R gene probes for the GeneChip
ST1.1 array by BLASTing them against human transcript sequences (evalue cutoff of 0.01, with
at least 12/25 exact matches). The genes TAS2R43 to TAS2R46 had overlapping, high similarity
matching probes, suggesting possible cross-hybridization, while the rest of the receptors’ probes
were deemed independent by this analysis. These associations, prevalent in both cohorts, highlight
a common module of G protein-coupled receptors that have been previously observed to be expressed
in the healthy and failing heart (55, 56], and that may play a role in regulation of arrhythmia and
contractility [54]. In summary, our heart transplant cardiac samples and inferred gene co-expression
networks enabled us to find several previously unidentified cardiac eQTLs in the failing and non-
failing heart. Many of the eQTL variants were also associated with cardiac phenotypes in GWAS and
some are associated with genes in highly-connected parts of the co-expression network, suggesting

coordinated regulation.

Dynamic network topology illuminates central HF regulators

Next, we used our network topology to identify and prioritize genes that were dynamically connected
between the failing and control heart networks. Our goal was to identify genes whose network con-
nectivity was increased in the disease state (ie. HF), but specifically to pathways known to be
relevant to the global control of HF mechanisms. We achieved this by ranking genes on two con-
nectivity metrics: i) differential local network connectivity for each gene between control and failing
networks, and ii) change in each gene’s connectivity globally to HF-relevant molecular pathways
manually curated from KEGG and Reactome. We defined local connectivity (LC) as the change
in number of edges for each gene between the control and HF networks. Global connectivity (GC)
was defined as the number of curated HF-relevant pathways to which each gene was significantly
differentially connected in the control vs. HF networks, taking into account network distance (see
Methods, Supplementary Figure 5).

Using GC and LC, we assigned each gene to one of four categories (Figure 3.54): Non-coordinators
were genes with decreased LC and GC between the control and HF networks, making them less likely
to be highly impactful in the disease state. Local coordinators had significant increases in LC but de-
creased GC, indicating high co-expression, but mostly with genes unrelated to global HF processes.
Pathway coordinators were genes with increased GC but overall low LC, indicating an increased

association with global HF processes, but overall low impact with respect to gains in co-expression.

1.1.3. Empirical evidence of effectiveness
Background

The BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines appear highly effective in
preventing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) illness. Augmenting efficacy evidence from clinical trials [18, 21], obser-
vational studies among healthcare workers [119, 25], adults aged 65 years or older [117], and the
general community [63, 15] have reported levels of protection from full vaccination ranging from 89%
to 95%. However, except for two relatively small studies of partial vaccination in skilled nursing
facilities [37, 34], no published studies to date have examined the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines
in congregate settings, where risks of transmission are very high.

Prisons and jails are especially risky congregate settings. Living quarters are often densely
populated and poorly ventilated, physical distancing is typically infeasible, and pre-existing medical
conditions associated with severe COVID-19 illness are prevalent among incarcerated people [42, 46].
Recognizing these risks and the considerable potential for vaccines to reduce them, approximately
half of US states have prioritized incarcerated people for COVID-19 vaccines. In contrast, [24] states
have not included incarcerated people in vaccine distribution plans or have assigned them to lowest
priority tiers.[91, 115]

The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR), which operates the second
largest state prison system, launched a COVID-19 vaccination program on December 22, 2020, and
rapidly scaled up the program across its 35 prisons.[40] CDCR has conducted extensive testing and
collected detailed data relevant to COVID-19 risks, interventions, and outcomes. We analyzed these
data to estimate effectiveness of mRNA vaccines against confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection among

nearly 61,000 incarcerated people in California.

Methods

Study design and population

We conducted a retrospective cohort study spanning the 70-day period from December 22, 2020,
through March 1, 2021, during which residents were offered either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vac-
cines. Prioritization criteria CDCR used to direct first-dose offers changed over time as supply
expanded and state and federal guidance evolved. Criteria included residency in a specialized med-
ical or psychiatric care setting, age and medical comorbidities, no confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection
(or none in the previous 90 days), and participation in penal labor. CDCR prioritized timely second-
dose offers to adhere to recommended dosing schedules.

Residents were eligible for inclusion in the study cohort if they were incarcerated in a CDCR
prison on the study start date and had no prior confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cohort members

contributed observation time beginning on the study start date and ending on the day of the earliest

CHAPTER 3. METHODS IN PRECISION HEALTH 51

pathways in skeletal muscle, and our own analysis implicated it in pyruvate, and other metabolic
pathways (Figure 3.5C) (116, 109]. Elimination of PPP1R3A in a murine model of cardiomyopathy
revealed a maladaptive role for this gene in HF, and our in vitro studies highlight the metabolic
switch of failing myocardium: toward inefficient glycolytic glucose metabolism and away from the
use of pyruvate in respiratory metabolism (Figure 3.8D).

While a great strength of this study is its immediate isolation of RNA from freshly explanted
human tissue, the resultant networks are not based on gene expression from a single cell type, but
rather whole cardiac tissue. While the expression-based networks we use lend themselves to the
construction of networks that bridge cell types, we cannot state with certainty that the identified
central coordinators are resultant of gene-gene interactions within cardiomyocytes alone, though
many of them changed significantly with PPP1R3A knockdown in NRVMs (Figure 3.8A). In the same
vein, as the causes of HF leading to transplant are diverse, the network-based hypotheses generated
by this work are likely to highlight final common pathways of HF resulting from diverse etiologies.
This can be viewed as a strength of this work as it is applicable across these multiple etiologies,
however, additional studies investigating the early stages of specific HF etiologies will add equally to
the literature in future. It must also be noted that, due to the nature of the cohort of control hearts
available for transplant, control hearts here are not free of disease (e.g. diabetes, Supplementary
Table 1). Though there are more male hearts included in the HF group than control hearts, principal
component analysis of gene expression does not reveal segregation by sex (Supplementary Figure
3.6). Nevertheless, we controlled for this variable in both the network and eQTL analyses.

Since genome-wide expression studies were introduced, there has been interest in quantifying
genes that are significantly differentially expressed, e.g. between failing and non-failing states. What
this linear, unitary approach fails to capture are mechanisms influencing higher order phenotypes
reflected in re-wiring of transcriptional partners that do not affect expression levels of specific genes.
Earlier work has already led to the discovery of central genes using co-expression changes [49, 127].
Here, we expanded this use of gene co-expression by exploiting not only gene interaction degree,
but also integrated topological network differences and known pathway information. In our HF
networks, we have shown how differences between these network topology properties in failing and
non-failing hearts can be used to uncover novel mechanisms and highlight new putative therapeutic

targets.

CHAPTER 1. EQUITY IN HEALTH POLICIES 4

Results

From March 1 to October 10, 2020, the resident population of California prisons decreased from
119,401 to 96,623 (Figure 1.1), a reduction of 19.1% that reversed prior trends [5]. High security
prisons (7.0%) and medical prisons (14.4%) had the smallest relative reductions.

On October 10, 2020, 96.7% of residents were male and 11.5% were aged 60 years or older.
Nearly three-quarters were Hispanic (44.5%) or non-Hispanic Black (29.5%). Forty percent had at
least one medical condition, and 18.3% had a Covid-19 risk score of > 3. The average number of
residents per room decreased from 20 to 10. However, seven prisons still averaged > 20 occupants
per room in October 2020, and 25 had > 1 room with > 20 occupants. The proportion of residents
in dormitories decreased from 37.1% to 30.9%, though a substantial fraction of higher risk residents
were still housed in dormitories.

By October 10, 81.8% (79,046) of still-incarcerated individuals had been tested for Covid-19 at
least once, and a total of 96,440 residents including those released between March and October had
been tested. Of the 96,440 residents, 15,162 were positive; 13,636 of these cases resolved by October
10—3.2% were hospitalized, 0.3% were in intensive care units, and 0.5% died. Severe Covid-19
outcomes were most likely for older and higher risk residents.

Participation in out-of-room activities other than labor decreased precipitously between March
and April 2020 and remained low through October. However, labor participation decreased only
slightly during the study period (Figure 1.2). The lowest levels of and the largest decreases in
labor participation were among residents aged > 80 years, but more than 10% of residents in this
age group and more than 20% of 70-79 year-olds were still participating in labor in October. These
labor participation results were generally consistent according to resident risk measures, prison types,
and outbreak history.

In the nine prisons with outbreaks that met our eligibility criteria for the multivariable risk
analysis, 21,750 eligible residents living in 6,928 rooms were tested at least once. Over 90 days,
the cumulative percentage of each prison’s population tested ranged from 21.3 to 99.9%, and the
cumulative percentage of each prison’s population confirmed positive ranged from 2.4 to 45.1%.

Rates of Covid-19 infection among residents of dormitories (> 3 occupants) were more than
double those among residents of cells (Adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 2.51; 95% Confidence Interval
[CI], 2.25-2.80; pj0.001) (Figure 1.3). Residents of rooms with occupants participating in out-of-room
labor also had higher rates of infection compared to those without participation (AHR, 1.56; 95% CI,
1.39-1.74). These differences represent a cumulative risk of infection that is 28.6 percentage points
higher (95% CI, 16.7-30.6%; 62.1% vs. 33.4%) for dormitories compared to cells, and 13.1 percentage
points higher (95% CI, 12.8-13.3%; 53.7% vs. 40.6%) for rooms with labor participation than for
rooms without it. Estimates proved fairly robust in sensitivity analyses. While, in theory, residents
with higher Covid-19 risk scores may take greater precautions to avoid more severe consequences

from infection, analyses that included this variable did not detect an association with lower risks.

prevent outbreaks but also to increase protective measures taken for their large, medically vulnerable
subpopulations, including further reductions in the density of living arrangements [125].

Our access to person-level, daily data from a large prison system with high rates of testing created
analytical opportunities that recent studies of Covid-19 in incarcerated populations have not had,
including minimizing biases from selection into testing, However, our study also had limitations.
First, we could not identify networks of specific contacts, a limitation that is likely to have mattered
most to our estimates of the effect of labor participation. Second, we used room occupancy to indicate
in-room contacts because density measures (e.g., residents per square foot) were not available. The
most plausible effect of misclassifying room exposures would be to bias to the null our estimates of the
effect of living in higher occupancy rooms. Third, we lacked information on some potential exposures,
such as contacts with staff and during meals in common areas. Finally, although CDCR undertook
extensive testing, not all residents were tested and test frequency varied across institutions. If
residents of dormitories or of rooms with labor participation were tested relatively frequently, or
testing there more precisely targeted infected residents, our estimates of these factors on infection
risk may be biased upward.

Prisons remain particularly dangerous settings for Covid-19-related morbidity and mortality.
Our study shows that thousands of vulnerable incarcerated people continue to be housed in settings
where their risk of Covid-19 infection is high. Protective measures such as decarceration, testing,
vaccination, and efforts to enhance vaccine uptake remain vital [45]. Residents at greatest risk of
transmission and infection, such as those living dormitories and participating in labor, should be

prioritized. Furthermore, as correctional systems offer vaccination to residents, our study highlights

CHAPTER 1. EQUITY IN HEALTH POLICIES 2

Data

CDCR provided data on all incarcerated people aged > 18 years residing in its prisons during the
period March 1 through October 10, 2020. The data were provided at the person-day-level, which
allowed daily tracking of changes in any time-varying information until residents’ release or death.

The data included variables indicating residents’ demographic (sex, age, and race or ethnicity)
and health characteristics; location; participation in prison labor, education, and other activities; and
Covid-19 testing history. The data contained each resident’s security level (1 [lowest] to 4 [highest])
which determines housing locations and eligibility for work and other activities [4]. Locational
information specified the room in which each resident spent the night. Rooms were defined as
discrete spaces, at least partially enclosed by solid walls, and were classified as cells or dormitories
of varying sizes.

The health information included indicators for diagnosed medical conditions and Covid-19 risk
score. This score, developed by CDCR, is an integer-based estimate of each resident’s probabil-
ity of severe health outcomes following Covid-19 infection. Scores correspond to the presence of
demographic and clinical characteristics identified in the literature as risk factors for severe Covid-
19-related illness, and CDCR considers scores > 3 to indicate high-risk (Table $1).

Testing information included dates and results. CDCR has been testing residents using real-time
PCR and antigen tests since April 2020. Testing expanded during the study period, eventually
employing both reactive mass testing and periodic surveillance testing. Prisons experiencing large
outbreaks tested residents at particularly high rates. By Fall 2020, all prisons were testing 5-25% of
residents every two weeks.

We created variables to describe risk factors for Covid-19 exposure and transmission, based
on residents’ housing situation and their participation in out-of-room activities. With respect to
housing, we calculated the daily number of residents housed in each room (square footage of rooms
was unavailable). This count variable had a bimodal distribution, with many residents living alone
or with one other resident, or in substantially larger rooms (> 10 residents), and relatively few in
between. For some analyses we dichotomized this variable, distinguishing residents in “cells” (1-2
occupants) and “dormitories” (> 3 occupants); this aligned with CDCR’s conception of the major
division in room sizes.

With respect to activities, the resident-day-level data included information on residents’ out-
ofroom participation in labor (e.g., janitorial), education (e.g., high school classes), and other
activities (e.g., religious services) [11, 8]. From April 2020, educational activities were confined
to residents’ rooms. Consequently, we focused on labor and other out-of-room non-educational
activities excluding recreation and meals which were not comprehensively tracked. We specified
variables indicating whether each resident participated in each activity type and variables indicating
whether each resident or a roommate did so in the previous two weeks.

Finally, we classified prisons into 5 categories based on the predominant resident security levels,

CHAPTER 1. EQUITY IN HEALTH POLICIES 23

(0.4 confirmed infections per 10,000 person-days); lower testing (474 tests per 10,000 person-days);
and high overall vaccination coverage rates (72% and 75% of cohort members who were still in

custody had received at least one dose or had tested positive by April 1 and July 1, respectively).

Discussion

This study found that BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines were highly effective against confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 infection among members of a high-risk and racially diverse population of incarcer-
ated people. Beginning 14 days after a second mRNA vaccine dose, estimated effectiveness in this
population was 97%. The vaccines were also highly effective among prison residents at higher risk
for severe COVID-19 illness.

Our estimates of effectiveness among fully-vaccinated people in California prisons was higher
than estimates reported by Cavanaugh et al [37] from a skilled nursing facility (66% among resi-
dents and 76% among staff from 14 days after a second BNT162b2 dose), though similar to those
reported for healthcare and other frontline workers by Thompson et al [119] (91% from 14 days after
second mRNA vaccine dose) and Angel et al [25] (86% from 7 days after second BNT162b2 dose).
Population-level studies in Israel by Dagan et al [15] and Haas et al [63] also reported similar results
(92% and 95%, respectively, from 7 days after second BNT162b2 dose) as our study. Estimates
of effectiveness of partial vaccination are more variable. We estimated 74% effectiveness against
infection from 14 days after a first mRNA vaccine dose until receipt of second dose. This result was
lower than Thompson et al’s [119] estimate of 81% among healthcare and other frontline workers
from 14 days after first mRNA vaccine dose until 14 days after second dose, but substantially higher
than Dagan et al’s [15] estimates of 46% for days 14 through 20 after first BNT162b2 dose and 60%
for days 21 through 27.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccination
program in a carceral setting. It has several strengths. We used detailed daily information on
vaccination status and key COVID-19 outcomes for each resident. These data allowed us to adjust
for key potential confounders, including risk factors for severe COVID-19, housing arrangements, and
participation in penal labor. An extensive testing program in this population facilitated relatively
complete measurement of SARS-CoV-2 infections. In addition, the large sample size permitted
estimates of effectiveness within particular subgroups of interest (e.g., medically vulnerable).

Understanding vaccine effectiveness among people at high risk for severe disease is a priority. Our
estimated effectiveness for partial and full vaccination did not differ appreciably between the full
cohort and subsets characterized by moderate or high risk for severe COVID-19 illness. This bolsters
growing evidence that mRNA vaccines provide substantial protection in older adults [117, 15], people
with pre-existing conditions [15, 122], and residents of skilled nursing facilities [37, 34]. Our results
also extend evidence from studies of healthcare workers indicating these vaccines are effective in

environments characterized by high transmission risks.

accounting for gender, age, sample site, and the PEER factors as covariates. We corrected for eQTL
multiple association testing using a 10000 permutations per locus in a 2 megabase window and a
false discovery rate cutoff of 5%. To select the number of PEER factors, we performed the full
analysis multiple times from 1 to 15 PEER factors and observed a saturation of new QTLs being
discovered when using 10 factors. To intersect our variants with GTEX and the GWAS catalog,
we simply matched based on rsid and position. High-resolution co-localization analysis on coronary
artery disease GWAS hits was performed using the eCAVIAR pipeline (see details in Methods) [31].
To find independent eQTLs, we performed LD-pruning (LD, pairwise r 2 < 0.5 within a window of
50 kb). QQ plots for eQTL p-values before and after correction for age, gender and site are provided

in Figure 3.3, and were not significantly inflated by batch correction.

Cardiac GWAS co-localization analysis

We tested whether any of our eQTLs co-localized with the signals from a publicly available GWAS on
coronary artery disease54. We ran the eCAVIAR [74] pipeline using the FINEMAP implementation
on all loci with at least one SNP with p < le—5 in the GWAS and at least one SNP with p < le—5
in either condition of our eQTL study. We found evidence of co-localization at 6 genes: MRAS,
TCF21, GPR22, LIPA, ZNF664, and EIF2B2. EIF2B2, TCF21, and ZNF664 co-localized in both
failing and healthy hearts. However, LIPA co-localized only in healthy hearts, while GPR22 and
MRAS co-localized only in failing hearts. These context-specific co-localizations highlight genes
that may contribute to heart disease progression specifically in healthy (LIPA) or in already-failing
hearts (GPR22, MRAS). LIPA codes for the lysosomal enzyme lipase A. GPR22 has previously
been shown to play a protective role against myocardial stress[?]. The protein MRAS is a muscle-
expressed homolog of the Ras oncogene family, currently without any well-characterized mechanism

in coronary artery disease.

Quantifying global and local centrality using network and community membership pa-

rameters

The local connectivity metric (LC) of any gene G was calculated as the difference between max-
normalized weighted network degree of G. The global connectivity metric (GC) of any gene G was
calculated as the number of gene sets that were significantly differentially enriched between gene
rankings of failing and control networks obtained by ordering the genes by their absolute correlation
coefficient to G.

After inferring the gene co-expression networks for both cohorts, we calculated topological prop-
erties for each gene in each network in order to get a sense of a gene’s role in the networks and in
the context of known pathways and gene sets. To this end, we defined a gene g’s differential global
connectivity (GC) as the number of curated HF relevant pathways within its neighborhood (defined

by genes lying within a set rank of absolute edge weight to gene g) that were significantly enriched

modeling approach to extrapolate from health surveys. The correlation between these two databases
are low (Figure 2.4), with asthma having an R? of 0.31 and cardiovascular disease having an R? of
0.05.

Health metrics are very difficult to measurement and prone to bias, especially at this level of
granularity. Census tracts give a false sense of precision, despite the levels of measurement error.
Additionally, each method of measurement is prone to their own source of bias. For example, ER-
based measures may underestimate the prevalence of disease for subgroups that may underutilize

ERs.

2.3.3 Model design

Air pollution is known to cause and exacerbate a variety of respiratory diseases such as asthma and
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease otherwise known as COPD. Under the current algorithm,
asthma is the only respiratory disease that is included.

However, auditing fairness for this algorithm is challenging. First, it is an unsupervised settings,
so unlike many other fairness applications, there is no ground truth. Second, the unit of observation
is census tracts, which are aggregate population units with continuous attributes of race, immigration
history, and socioeconomic status, so traditional evaluation metrics such as group fairness will not
work.

To apply fairness to unsupervised settings, we propose using discordance between two models as a

metric of change between a proposed model and the current model. Additionally, to examine fairness

Abstract

Advances in statistics, econometrics, and computer science have the potential to facilitate data-

 

driven decision making in improving the health of populations. However, adapting modern data
science methods to eliminate health disparities remains challenging because interventions based sin-
gularly on health data do not fully address health issues borne from structural, upstream inequities.
A multi-level approach that integrates social and health data to characterize how specific social sys-
tems perpetuate health inequities provides opportunities to create more tailored health and social
policies. I will discuss examples of addressing health inequity through data science in two contexts:
(1) mass incarceration in relationship to public health policies, and (2) algorithmic fairness for struc-
turally vulnerable populations in social policy. An underlying theme is the importance of statistical
methodology and study design informed by a holistic understanding of the interplay between social

and health systems.

housing configurations, and CDCR advice: reception centers, medical prisons, low security and

general population prisons, high security prisons, and mixed security and medium security prisons.

Methods

We calculated changes over the study period in the size and composition of the incarcerated popu-
lation, in housing, and in participation in out-of-room activities.

We used person-level survival analysis to estimate the association between room occupancy and
labor activities, respectively, and rates of Covid-19 infection. We focused on sustained within-prison
transmission, therefore limiting the analysis to prisons with outbreaks involving substantial resident-
to-resident spread. We defined prisons with outbreaks as those having > 50 cumulative cases during
the study period and > 10 incident cases detected on at least one day in that period. We defined
an outbreak’s start date as 14 days prior to the first day with > 10 incident cases.

We specified several additional prison-level and resident-level eligibility criteria for the survival
analysis. Briefly, to allow > 90 days follow-up, we excluded prisons (n=7) with outbreaks that began
after July 12, 2020; to minimize confounding, we excluded one prison with testing rates that differed
substantially between cells and dormitories; and we excluded prisons (n=3) whose outbreaks were
seeded by mass introduction of cases (e.g., San Quentin), because their epidemic growth may have
been atypical. Within eligible prisons, we included residents present on the day the outbreak began
who were tested for Covid-19 at least once during the 90-day period.

The observation period for eligible residents’ observation ran from the start of their prison’s
outbreak until the sample collection date of their first positive test or their last negative test.
Release or transfer to another prison were also censoring events.

We fit a multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression model to estimate the associations
of interest. The outcome variable indicated the sample collection date for the first positive Covid-
19 test result among residents who had a positive test. The main exposure variables were room
occupancy at the outbreak start and room-level labor participation during the 14-day period prior

ssed the appropriateness of the

 

to the outbreak start. We also included prison fixed effects. We ass

proportional hazards assumption by inspecting plots of Schoenfeld residuals.

 

We conducted sensitivity analyses. Because there may be systematic differences in how residents
with higher Covid-19 risk scores or higher security levels mix with other residents, we added baseline
values of these covariates. We varied the required follow-up period for prison inclusion. We allowed
the observation period for residents who did not test positive, exit the prison, or die to extend to
the end of the study period, regardless of their last negative test date. We estimated the model

clustering standard errors at the room and prison levels.

Discussion

Over a 7-month period following the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the resident population of
California state prisons decreased by one-fifth and room occupancy halved. However, many medically
vulnerable residents remained incarcerated, and a substantial proportion of them continued to live
in dormitory housing and participate in work activities that involved mixing. In nine prisons that
experienced large outbreaks, we found that residents living in rooms with > 2 others had a 2.5-fold
higher infection rate and that residents in a room whose occupants participated in out-of-room work
had a 1.6-fold higher rate. Since the pandemic began CDCR has taken drastic steps to mitigate
transmission and stem outbreaks. Nonetheless, as of February 13, 2021, there had been 48,758
confirmed cases among residents and 205 deaths. These represent substantially higher rates of
infection and mortality that state’s general population has experienced.

The patterns we observed suggest opportunities for further risk reduction. The substantial
numbers of older and higher-risk residents who continue to live in high occupancy rooms is an
important target group for prevention efforts. Members of those high-risk groups who participate
in group activities, or who share a room with others who do, are also an important target group.

Our results are consistent with key messages from the limited evidence base on respiratory
infections in incarcerated populations [80, 65, 78, 100, 105, 112, 123, 108, 22, 71, 28, 43, 83, 90,
96]. The interconnected nature of the residents of congregate institutions means that outbreaks,
especially those that penetrate higher occupancy rooms, can quickly become building or prison

outbreaks. Correctional facilities, nationally and internationally, should redouble efforts not only to

1.1.2 Social behavioral factors of accepting public health policies
Background

The Covid-19 pandemic has ravaged prisons and jails. To date, nearly 400,000 cases and 2,500
deaths have occurred among incarcerated people in the United States (U.S.) alone [14], with case
and mortality rates that far exceed those in the general community [69]. The infeasibility of key
non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., social distancing) for preventing transmission helps explain
the elevated risk, as does the high prevalence of chronic diseases in this population [41] . The Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended that incarcerated people be prioritized
for Covid-19 vaccines [2], but states are taking different approaches [82]. A few states began imple-
menting vaccination programs in correctional institutions as soon as vaccines became available, and
have already offered doses to many residents; other states have not yet begun offering vaccinations
in these settings [82, 77]. Vaccine hesitancy is common in jails and prisons, in part because of
limited access to information and widespread mistrust of correctional authorities and the medical
providers [29]. Racial and ethnic minorities, a majority of many incarcerated populations, are dis-
proportionately unlikely to accept vaccination and other medical interventions. The high threshold

for achieving herd immunity in prisons and jails amplifies the risks associated with under-vaccination

 

[102]. California prioritized incarcerated people for Covid-19 vaccination. The California Depart-
ment of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR), which operates the country’s second largest state
prison system, launched a vaccination program for residents in late 2020 and scaled it up rapidly.
We tracked the program’s rollout, focusing on the proportion and characteristics of residents who

accepted vaccine offers.

Methods

Vaccination program
CDCR launched its program on December 22, 2020, in three prisons with the largest medically
vulnerable populations. Rollouts at other prisons followed, with the last prison commencing vac-
cinations on January 19, 2021. Within prisons, the criteria CDCR used to prioritize residents for
vaccination changed over time as vaccine shipments arrived and new state and federal guidances
were issued. The prioritization criteria variously included residency in a specialized medical or psy-
chiatric care settings, risk factors for severe outcomes from Covid-19, no confirmed SARS-CoV-2
infection (or none in the previous 90 days), employment in a high-contact job, and due dates for a
second dose.

Residents received one of the two vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) authorized for emer-
gency use in the U.S. at the time of our study period, December 22, 2020, through March 4, 2021.
Vaccination was voluntary, and residents were permitted to decline without sanction. Prison health-

care staff recorded whether each vaccine dose offered was accepted or declined. Residents who

CHAPTER 3. METHODS IN PRECISION HEALTH 47

This percentage of newly identified eQTLs is larger than on previous, related eQTL studies
(64, 86], and also displays greater overlap with GTEx than those found in an independent cohort of
patients with dilated cardiomyopathy [64]. This large overlap was encouraging, and since we control
for known and hidden covariates, our difference in eQTLs compared to related studies may reflect
the immediate tissue collection techniques we used, and the difference in disease status (at least one
third of cases in this study had ischemic disease, which was not true for comparison studies, which
focused on non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy [64]).

To assess the physiological impact of our eQTLs, we checked for overlap of our eQTL associations
with existing variants in the GWAS catalog [126]. First, we did a simple, direct SNP overlap check
with the GWAS variants by (GWAS catalog variants with an LD cutoff of 0.6, using SNiPA [27]
to check for LD overlaps). For HF eQTLs, this revealed 41 variants, among which we found 25
associations with sudden cardiac arrest, heart rate variability, and coronary heart disease among
other diseases/traits, whereas 33 of the non-failing control eQTLs had associations in the catalog,
including QT interval and heart rate variability traits. To assess whether the magnitude of this
overlap was higher than expected, we used SNPSNAP [103] to generate two sets of 10000 random
variants each with the same LD and gene density characteristics as our failing and non-failing eQTLs.
The average overlap of these random sets to GWAS variants was 0.1 for both sets, yielding empirical
p-values of less than 0.001 in each set and confirming that our overlap is higher than expected.

To expand our analysis of overlap of our eQTL findings with GWAS, we used eCAVIAR [74],

Equity in social policies

2.1 Background

An open-source data tool is used in California to identify “disadvantaged communities” considered
most vulnerable to environmental exposures, a designation through which hundreds of millions of
dollars in social welfare funding is allocated annually. Due to the lack of ground truth in determining
disadvantaged communities, creating a single index to determine environmental vulnerability is
inevitably a subjective task. We audit the data tool and compare it with plausible model alternatives,
finding technical errors, measurement errors, and subjective model choices that ultimately lead to
substantial variations in funding allocations. We urge that tools such as this should be designed by
and in collaboration with community leaders, domain experts, and regulatory agencies in order to
avert misallocation of funding and exacerbation of social inequities.

In 2012, California Senate Bill 535 was signed into law, allocating 25% of California’s proceeds
from its cap-and-trade program to social welfare funds for environmentally disadvantaged commu-
nities. CalEnviroScreen, an open-source data tool, was created by CalEPA to identify and designate
disadvantaged communities. The tool directs about $200 million of funding annually from Califor-
nia’s cap-and-trade program alone; it also directly influences funding from a variety of public and
private sources, and is reported to have directed an estimated $12.7 billion in funding.

The tool takes Census tract-level data on pollution burden and population characteristics and
reduces it into a single score; the Census tracts in the top 25% of scores are designated “disad-
vantaged communities.” The pollution burden category is split into two subcategories: exposures
and environmental effects; the population characteristics category is also split into two subcate-
gories: socioeconomic factors and sensitive populations. All categories are weighted equally except
for environmental effects, which is half-weighted. Variables in each subcategory are converted to
ranked percentiles then averaged together into a subcategory score. The subcategory scores are

then averaged into category scores (pollution burden and population characteristics), which are

Equity in health policies

1.1 Mass incarceration

1.1.1 Decarceration and ongoing risks
Background

Over 380,000 incarcerated people in the United States were diagnosed with severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 through February 2021, and approximately 2,300 died [10]. Prisons are
vulnerable to rapid viral spread, given their population density and the infeasibility of standard
distancing measures [80, 65, 78, 100, 105, 112, 123]. Covid-19-related health outcomes appear worse
among incarcerated people than in the general population [65, 108, 22].

Correctional systems face difficult trade-offs in their attempts to control Covid-19 transmission.
Early releases reduce crowding but may cause public unrest [71]. Curtailing in-prison activities (e.g.,
work or group therapy) limits mixing but is disruptive and may have adverse health effects [28, 43].
The federal government has issued guidance [12, 9] on measures to reduce Covid-19 transmission in
correctional settings, but the recommendations lack specificity and evidence of efficacy. The evidence
base in this area remains extremely limited.

The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) manages the country’s
second largest prison system, with 35 institutions that housed 120,000 residents in early 2020.
CDCR has undertaken multiple interventions to prevent and contain Covid-19 outbreaks. This
study describes how CDCR’s incarcerated population has changed during the pandemic, focusing
on room occupancy and participation in out-of-room activities. For prisons that have experienced
outbreaks, we estimate the extent to which those two factors are associated with Covid-19 infection

rates.

Figure 2.1: Calculating the CalEnviroScreen Score. CalEnviroScreen is a formula that balances
dozens of factors to determine the state’s most vulnerable commmunities, labeling the top quartile
of census tracts as “disadvantaged.” The designation is used to prioritize communities for billions of
dollars in government and private funding.

2.2 Methods

Prior to data analysis, we identified potential flaws in the data tool and conceived plausible alterna-
tive models. We then built the alternative models and evaluated how they differed from the original

model.

2.2.1 Subjectivity in pre-processing

We propose using Z-score standardization instead of percentile ranking as a way of converting each
variable onto the same scale before converting into an index. Percentile ranking changes the distri-
bution of each variable into a uniform distribution and is not typically used as a scaling procedure;
Z-score standardization preserves the original distribution of the raw data and is widely used as a

scaling procedure.

(Supplementary Figure 1). Second, we confirmed enhanced expression of NPPA and NPPB, deple-
tion of SERCA24A, and a shift from MYH7 towards MYH6 expression — established signatures of HF
(Figures 3.1A and B). In total, 793 genes were significantly up-regulated in failing hearts compared
to non-failing and 848 were down-regulated (fold change greater or lesser than 2 or 0.5 respectively,
with FDR < 0.01). Finally, as our sample collection was performed immediately before or after
cardiac transplantation, (unlike post-mortem samples such as those used in GTex) we investigated
whether gene expression programs related to oxidative stress were less perturbed than in samples
collected post-mortem. To do this, we compared oxidative stress gene expression as defined by genes
in the GO term “Response to oxidative stress” (GO:0006979) in our samples to left ventricular
sample data in GTEx, as well as other KEGG and Reactome pathways (data obtained from the
recount2 database[44]). Our results suggested that our samples displayed comparable contractility-
related gene expression but had significantly less oxidative-stress related gene expression and less
perturbation in other metabolic pathways (Figure 3.1C). Having established the quality of our data,
we limited our network-based downstream analyses to the 40% genes most variably expressed be-
tween failing and non-failing hearts (a=7960) in order to limit inflation of correlation between low

covariance gene pairs.

Cardiac co-expression maps reveal dynamic network topology

We inferred undirected, disease-state-specific gene co-expression networks. Gene regulatory network
inference from co-expression is a challenging problem that no single method solves adequately in
all contexts. Here, we constructed control- and HF- specific networks using methods that rely on
gene co-expression (Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA)[84, 85] and Pearson
correlation), inverse covariance estimation (Joint Graphical LASSO (JGL) [47]), and mutual infor-
mation (ARACNe [92] and ZScore). Each of these methods has specific advantages for different
questions, e.g. JGL creates a sparser network with the specific intent of reducing representation
of non-causal associations, whereas WGCNA relies on denser network topology to capture modules
of genes with high likelihood of interaction. Since our downstream analysis required a top-down
systems view of coexpression networks, and because we planned to prioritize genes based on the
change in connectivity of networks between disease states, we chose to base our subsequent analyses
on WGCNA-derived networks, which represent a robust tool for this purpose.[{128, 113] To achieve
an initial understanding of topological changes between the non-failing and failing heart networks,
we compared the structure of modules in each WGCNA-derived network (dendrograms used for
module finding shown in Figure 3.4). These networks displayed different structure in HF than in
control: First, the number of genes unassigned to any module was much fewer in HF (13 genes
were unassigned, compared to 2614 in controls). Second, while each group of genes was specifically
enriched with functional annotations as revealed by enrichR [38], the HF modules had more diversity

of signaling and metabolic annotations.

Figure 3.5: (A) Diagrammatic representation of roles of local and global connectivity in defining
each gene’s coordinator status. Local connectivity (LC) is the per-gene change in co-expression
edges in the HF versus control network. Global connectivity (GC) represents the enrichment of
HF-relevant pathways in a gene’s neighborhood between HF and control networks (see Methods).
(B) Change in local and global connectivity for all genes between control and HF networks identi-
fied PPP1R3A (green font) as a central coordinator in HF, indicating its increased association with

diomyopathy pathways (yellow indicates an increase in connectivity to the given pathway (columns)

Where degnorm(g, net) is the max-normalized weighted degree of gene g in network net (sum of
weights of edges that include g divided by the maximum network weight across all edges).

Both LC and GC are then Z-score normalized in order to call coordinator status:

e Central Coordinators have Z-score normalized LC and GC greater than zero.

e Local Coordinators have Z-score normalized LC greater than zero but GC less than zero.

e Pathway Coordinators have Z-score normalized GC greater than zero but LC less than zero.

e Non-coordinators have neither Z-score normalized GC or LC greater than zero.

RNA sequencing and analysis pipeline

After RNA extraction, RNA integrity was checked using a 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent); all RNA
samples had an RIN of 7.0 or higher. Samples were screened for PPP1R3A knockdown efficiency
and phenylephrine treatment using qRT-PCR prior to library construction. RNAseq libraries were
prepared using the TrueSeq Stranded mRNA kit (Illumina), according to manufacturer instruction.
Libraries were barcoded, quality-checked using a 2100 BioAnalyzer and run in rapid run flow cells
in a HiSeq 2500 (Illumina), producing at least 30 million paired-end reads.

Sequencing reads were aligned to the Rattus Norvegicus rn5 UCSC reference genome using the
STAR aligner [50]. Quantification and differential expression analysis of RNAseq data was per-
formed using the Cufflinks package [120]: full transcriptome assembly was performed with Cufflinks,
quantified with Cuffquant, and analyzed for differential expression using Cuffdiff. All genes deemed

Immediate tissue processing yields quality transcriptomic data

The MAGnet consortium was founded to establish best practices for the harvesting of human cardiac
tissue (see Methods) and to explore the genetic landscape of cardiac gene expression [67, 93, 35].
Using this consensus protocol, we obtained 1352 human cardiac samples and chose a subset of
313 hearts, including 177 failing hearts collected immediately post-transplantation and 136 healthy
donor controls that were suitable for transplantation but did not reach a recipient due to logistical
reasons. We genotyped and measured left-ventricular genome-wide gene expression of these samples,
controlling for known covariates, specifically age, gender and collection site. Principal component
analysis showed that additional exposures do not explain a significant proportion of variance in gene

expression (Figures 3.6A and 3.3).

We assessed the quality of these measurements in several ways. First, we found that disease

status was the dominant source of variation suggesting no major confounding sources of variation

CHAPTER 1. EQUITY IN HEALTH POLICIES 19

Secondary analyses

We conducted four sets of secondary analyses. First, we estimated effectiveness in two subgroups
of interest. Specifically, recognizing that our primary analysis mixes effects of two different vaccines,
we ran one subgroup analysis focusing on mRNA-1273 vaccinations only (which accounted for 78% of
all first doses and 72% of all doses administered in the study period). We also estimated effectiveness
among medically vulnerable residents by restricting the analytic cohort to residents with COVID-19
risk scores of 2 or higher, indicating moderate or high risk. Residents with COVID-19 risk scores of
2 or higher were either aged 65 years and older or younger than 65 years with comorbid conditions
associated with severe COVID-19 disease.

Second, we estimated effectiveness in a broader population that included residents with prior
infections and those who entered prison during the study period. Third, we examined the sensitivity
of our effectiveness estimates to alternative model specifications, including censoring observation
time at the collection date of cohort members’ last test (to exclude time periods in which infection
status was unknown), and computing cluster-robust variance estimators with clusters defined at
various levels (prison, facility, building, housing unit, floor, room, and person). Finally, to assess
the sensitivity of estimates to choice of study period, we re-estimated effectiveness using a series of

alternative study end dates between February 15 and July 1, 2021.

Results

Sample characteristics and vaccination uptake

 

60,707 residents met the cohort inclusion criteria and were followed for an average of 57.6 days
(median, 70 days). By February 1, 2021, 20% of them received at least one mRNA dose and 3%
received two doses; by March 1, 49% received at least one dose and 22% received two doses (Figure
1). The mean interval between doses was 20.8 days (standard deviation [SD]: 2.7) for those who
received two BNT162b2 doses and 28.0 days (SD: 3.5) days for those who received two mRNA-1273
doses.

Most cohort members were male (96%), younger than 60 years (88%), and either Hispanic or
Latino (43%) or non-Hispanic Black or African American (33%). Most had risk factors for severe
outcomes from COVID-19 infection: 84% had at least one medical condition defined by CDC as
a marker of severe COVID-19-related illness [6], and 31% had moderate or high COVID-19 risk
according to CDCR’s scoring algorithm. Cohort members who had received one or more vaccine
doses by the end of the study period tended to be older than those who had not, and were more
likely to have medical conditions and higher COVID-19 risk scores and be non-Hispanic White or

Hispanic or Latino.

Testing rates by vaccination category

Cohort members had a median of 6 COVID-19 tests during the study period (interquartile range:

Figure 1.5: Percentage of Residents Offered Covid-19 Vaccination Who Accepted at Least One
Dose. Shown are the predicted margins estimated from the results of multivariable logistic-regression
analyses of the sample of 64,387 incarcerated residents who were offered at least one dose of the
BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccine, with adjustments for room type (defined according to the number
of residents housed in a room), participation in penal labor, security level, and prison. All the
categories of race or ethnic group other than Hispanic indicate non-Hispanic residents. The California
Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) developed a risk score to grade residents’
likelihood of severe Covid-19-related disease. The risk score sums weighted values for 17 items
identified in the scientific literature as risk factors for severe outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection
(Table $1). We categorized scores into low risk (score of 0 or 1), medium risk (2 or 3), and high risk
(> 4). Residents were considered to have had a history of Covid-19 if they had had a positive test
result while in CDCR custody, before the date of the first offer of a vaccine.

diagnostic test, or study end date.

Data and key measures

CDCR collects and stores daily data on each resident. Data provided for this study included
demographic characteristics (sex, age, racial or ethnic group), documented history of 25 comorbid
conditions (e.g., hypertension, chronic kidney disease, asthma), and a composite COVID-19 risk
score. CDCR designed the COVID-19 risk score to grade risks of severe illness from SARS-CoV-2
infections based on individual demographic and clinical information, and the agency has used this
score to guide COVID-19 mitigation policies, including prioritization of testing and vaccination. We
also obtained person-day level variables indicating each resident’s prison, facility, building, housing
unit, floor, and room of residence; room type (cell or dormitory); security level; and participation
in penal labor.

Detailed SARS-CoV-2 testing information came from a multilayered resident testing program
that included risk-based routine testing, surveillance testing, and testing in response to detected
outbreaks. Information provided on accepted vaccine doses allowed us to classify cohort members’
daily vaccination status into six categories: unvaccinated, from 0 to 6 days after receiving a first
dose, from 7 to 13 days after a first dose, from 14 days after a first dose until receipt of a second
dose, from 0 to 13 days after a second dose, and from 14 days after a second dose.

To obtain a measure of risk of infection from correctional staff, we constructed a prison-day level
variable comprising the rolling 7-day COVID-19 case rate among staff at each prison. Infections
among correctional staff were identified through a program of regular SARS-CoV-2 testing, man-
dated and administered by CDCR.

Statistical analysis

To obtain estimates of vaccine effectiveness, we fit multivariable models using the Andersen-Gill

 

extension of the Cox proportional hazards model [24] to account for time-varying covariates using
person-day level data. The primary outcome of interest was SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed by
positive PCR or antigen test. We specified exposure status according to the six vaccination categories
described above. Effectiveness estimates are expressed as 1 minus the hazard ratio.

Analyses adjusted for residents’ racial or ethnic group, COVID-19 risk score, security level, room
type, participation in penal labor, staff case rate, and prison (fixed effects). We did not adjust for
sex because men and women are generally housed in separate prisons, making this variable highly
collinear with prison. To account for non-independence between cohort members, we clustered stan-
dard errors by housing unit. Housing units are discrete cohorts within prisons, consisting of residents

who co-participate in activities (e.g., recreation, laundry, dining).

CHAPTER 1. EQUITY IN HEALTH POLICIES 24

In observational cohort studies like ours, potential for bias due to confounding is an important
consideration. Vaccines were not offered randomly to residents—in particular those with risk factors
for severe disease were prioritized. Given the latency of biologically plausible protection, the days
after vaccination can serve as an indicator of bias, with large effectiveness estimates signaling sub-
stantial residual confounding [72]. We included an exposure category for the first week after a first
mRNA vaccine dose to assess the presence of such residual confounding, and detected a statistically
insignificant 16% effectiveness for this negative control exposure. Vasileiou et al [122]. reported a
much higher estimate, 86% protection against COVID-19 hospitalizations during the first week after
vaccination for BNT162b2, in a previous study on effectiveness in Scotland.

Residents were tested frequently (median 6 tests) during the 70-day study period, but testing was
neither routine, random nor compulsory, creating potential for ascertainment bias. Several results
provide some reassurance in this regard. First, vaccinated cohort members overall had 25% higher
testing rates than unvaccinated members. Thus, the most plausible bias from differential testing
would be more complete case detection among the vaccinated, which would lead to underestimating
vaccine effectiveness. Second, an analysis that censored follow-up on the last test collection date for
a cohort member produced effectiveness estimates similar to those from the main analysis.

Extending the study period through July 1, 2021 added four months in which testing and case
rates were low, and a relatively large proportion of prison residents had been vaccinated. We found
lower levels of estimated effectiveness for the fully vaccinated group over this extended period—an
expected result, and a trend seen in the six-month vaccine efficacy clinical trial for the BNT162b2
vaccine [118]. Accumulation of undetected infections that confer natural immunity may have con-
tributed to dilution of estimated effectiveness, especially among residents at lower risk for severe
COVID-19, who were generally tested less frequently and vaccinated later in the study period. Addi-
tional contributors may have included increasing bias in the composition of the unvaccinated group
towards residents who declined vaccination, as well as cohort selection induced by heterogeneity
in infection risk [60]. For instance, if the vaccine offered partial (or “leaky” ) protection [87], high
infection risk within an unvaccinated group that is initially highly susceptible could induce selection
bias over time as the most susceptible people are removed from the group, which would decrease
estimated effectiveness of vaccination.

The study has several other limitations. First, our estimates of effectiveness focused on confirmed
infections, not other important outcomes, such as symptomatic infections or severe disease. Incidence
of hospitalizations and deaths in our cohort during the study period was too low to support rigorous
analysis of those outcomes, and symptom reporting is unreliable in carceral settings [107]. A related
point is that we were only able to estimate effectiveness in relation to the date of test sample
collection, not transmission date, which allows for the possibility that some detected infections might
have preceded vaccination. Second, we evaluated effectiveness against any SARS-CoV-2 infection,

not specific viral variants, because CDCR conducted limited viral genome sequencing during the

study period. As the B.1.617.2 (delta) variant became dominant and cases rose in the general
community over the months of June and July [19, 16], CDCR detected a total of 286 cases among
a population of nearly 99,000 residents during this period [17], a substantially lower rate when
compared to the period between mid-March 2020 to mid-February 2021, during which the number
of cases were above 200 in almost every week, peaking at 5659 weekly cases in December 2020. Low
incidence after February 2021 suggests that there may be substantial protection against outbreaks in
this population with high levels of vaccination and prior infections, including during a period marked
by increasing prevalence of more highly transmissible variants. However, as people continue to
become infected and more outbreaks occur, further follow-up is necessary to reassess the effectiveness
and protection afforded by vaccines. Third, CDCR used some antigen tests, which have lower
sensitivity, potentially leading to under-detection of cases. However, at least 93% of all tests were
PCR, so we expect any bias related to antigen testing to be minimal. Finally, the generalizability
of our results to residents of jails and other correctional systems is unknown.

Residents of prisons and jails have borne a disproportionately large share of disease burden
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings from this study—building on a growing evidence base
indicating vaccine efficacy and effectiveness across a range of populations and settings-suggest that
mRNA vaccines are extremely effective in protecting incarcerated people against infection, including
residents at high risk of severe COVID-19 illness. Continued emphasis on vaccination and other
ongoing mitigation practices are essential in preventing COVID-19 in this disproportionately affected
population. Incarcerated people, correctional workers, and the wider community all stand to benefit

from those efforts.

over continuous, we propose examining the relationship between discordance and the continuous
attribute. To test the hypothesis that asthma may be a potentially biased indicator of respiratory
health, we compare census tracts designated as disadvantaged under the current algorithm and the
model with COPD instead of asthma. We calculate the pairwise discordance of disadvantage status
between the two models by the percent foreign born of each census tract (Figure ??). A positive
discordance indicates that a census tract was more likely to be designated as disadvantaged in the
COPD model compared to the asthma model.

As census tracts increase in percent foreign born, discordance increases. Given that California is
a state with a large immigrant population, this subjective choice may lead to under-funding within

immigrant populations.

CHAPTER 2. EQUITY IN SOCIAL POLICIES 28

Additionally, we propose averaging the pollution burden and population characteristics together
to create the CES score instead of multiplying them. Multiplying the two category scores inflates

high values and deflates low values from the category scores, exacerbating existing model error.

2.2.2 Measurement error

Currently, the data tool uses emergency room visits for asthma and myocardial infarction as proxies
for respiratory and cardiovascular health, respectively. Using ER visits as a metric is potentially
biased: although on average, lower-income populations use the ER disproportionately more, some
subgroups, such as immigrant populations, use the ER disproportionately less. We propose using a
mix of ER visits and Census tract-level survey data for a more robust estimate of respiratory and

cardiovascular health.

2.2.3 Model design

The inclusion and exclusion of variables to use in the model is inherently a subjective choice and can
result in inadvertent model bias. For example, we identify the use of asthma as a representative of
respiratory health as a potentially biased indicator. Because asthma is less prevalent in developing
countries, it is disproportionately less prevalent amongst immigrant populations in the US; conse-
quently, the model is potentially biased against neighborhoods with large immigrant populations.
As an alternative, we propose using a mix of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) as an indicator for respiratory health.

Additionally, respiratory and cardiovascular health are not the only areas of health affected by
environmental exposures. We propose using more indicators, such as renal function and neurological

disorders.

2.2.4 Evaluation

We evaluate model agreement between the original model and alternative models using a variety
of metrics ranging from area under the ROC curve, precision-recall, Cohen’s Kappa, etc. We also
evaluate heterogeneity in model agreement using discordance as a metric: if discordance between
two models increases as a protected attribute (e.g., race, age, etc) also increases, then the difference

in models presents as bias against the protected attribute.

Data and Variables
CDCR provided person-level data on residents’ demographic and clinical characteristics, housing,
and Covid-19 testing history. The demographic information included sex, age, race, and eth-
nicity. We grouped the race and ethnicity information, which came from a combination of self-
reports and administrative records, into categories used by the U.S. Census Bureau (Hispanic, non-
Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native, non-Hispanic
Asian/Pacific Islander, and non-Hispanic Other) [1].

CDCR developed a Covid-19 risk score to grade residents’ likelihood of severe Covid-19-related
disease. This risk score sums weighted values for 17 items identified in the scientific literature as
risk factors for severe outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table $1). We categorized scores
into “low” risk (scores of 0 and 1), “medium” risk (2 and 3), and “high” risk (> 4).

The data also included Covid-19 testing information. CDCR has undertaken extensive testing of
residents for SARS-CoV-2 since April 2020, using real-time PCR and antigen tests [41]. We defined
prior SARS-CoV-2 infection as having had at least one positive test while in CDCR custody.

In addition, the data included various carceral characteristics with potential relevance for vaccine
acceptance—particularly, security level, room type, and participation in penal labor. CDCR rates
each resident’s security level from 1 (lowest) to 4 (highest), based on a multifactorial assessment of
the resident’s risk of misconduct; this rating influences housing placement and eligibility for activi-
ties such as visitations, recreation, and penal labor. Residents are housed in rooms, discrete spaces
that are at least partially enclosed by solid walls. We defined room type according to the number of
residents housed in each room, dichotomizing this variable into cells (rooms with 1-2 occupants) and
dormitories (> 3 occupants). Finally, using information on residents’ participation in work roles
(e.g., janitorial, food preparation), we created a binary variable indicating whether each resident

had participated in penal labor within the prior 14 days.

Statistical Analysis
We calculated the proportion of residents who accepted first and second vaccine doses among res-
idents offered those doses (“offerees”). We also calculated patterns of acceptance among residents
who were re-offered vaccines after previously declining them (“re-offerees”).

We used multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify demographic characteristics associ-
ated with vaccine acceptance at the resident level. In the primary analysis, the outcome variable
distinguished offerees who accepted > 1 vaccine doses from offerees who did not accept any doses.
The four predictors of interest were age group (18-39 years, 40-64 years, > 65 years), racial or ethnic
group, Covid-19 risk score, and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. The model included prison fixed effects

and adjusted for residents’ security level, room type, and participation in penal labor. Time-varying

CHAPTER 3. METHODS IN PRECISION HEALTH 34

Condition-specific cardiac regulatory gene networks identify disease-driven changes in local and
global topology, illuminating PPP1R3A as a novel predicted HF regulator. Lastly, our in vitro and

in vivo approaches further demonstrate its role in HF pathology.

3.1.2 Methods
Tissue collection and processing

We established a collaborative multi-institution network with a 24/7 notification system and a team
of travel-ready surgeons at major transplant centers to systematize the collection of cardiac tissue
from failing hearts and unused heart transplant donors at operating rooms and remote locations. We
put in place a series of best practices for procurement of explanted cardiac transplant tissue including
harvesting explanted cardiac tissue at the time of cardiac surgery from subjects with HF undergoing
transplantation and from unused donor hearts. Hearts were perfused with cold cardioplegia solution
prior to cardiectomy to arrest contraction and prevent ischemic damage, and explanted cardiac tissue
specimens were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.

All samples were taken from the left ventricular free wall at the mid ventricular level (Segments
11 or 12) on the 17-segment model. On some of occasions, when it was necessary to avoid infarct
or peri-infarct tissue in these segments, we obtained tissues that may be closer to the base or apex
or more anterior or inferior (segments 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 16). The septum was never collected.
Histopathology using H&E and trichrome staining were used to avoid the use of donor hearts with
excess fibrosis or hypertrophy. Immunostaining was not performed.

The institutional review boards at all collection sites (including Stanford, the University of
Pennsylvania and the Cleveland Clinic) reviewed and approved the protocols used in this study
for procurement and use of human tissue and information. All participants gave informed consent

before enrollment.

Expression and genotype datasets and clinical variables

We performed RNA expression measurements and obtained genotype information in genome-wide
markers for 313 patients (177 failing hearts, 136 donor, non-failing [control] hearts) using Affymetrix
expression and Affymetrix Human 6.0 respectively. Clinical variables for each individual were

recorded during the course of the research and were compiled using REDCap[68].

Data pre-processing, covariate correction, and differential expression

Several technical and sample covariates can bias gene expression values inferred from our microar-
ray data, such as array batch effects and individual ethnicity, gender. These covariates can greatly
confound downstream analyses, resulting in false positive and negative associations and reducing

the power of statistical analyses. We corrected for these biases in three ways: by normalizing to

2.3 Results

2.3.1 Subjectivity in pre-processing

Percentile pre-processing greatly distorts the distribution of variables. For example, general scientific
literature suggests that PM2.5 is linearly related with health outcomes. However, the difference
between the 80th to 90th percentiles is just 0.3g/m? whereas the difference between the 90th to
100th percentiles is 4.1jug/m* (Figure 2.2

Figure 2.2: Percentile versus raw PM2.5 distribution.

While the model agreement across the state was quite high, at 0.91, this small change in pre-
processing is disproportionately large for certain geographic regions. In San Francisco, census tracts
classified as disadvantaged were quite varied between pre-processing techniques (Figure 77). The
reason for this is two-fold. Percentile ranking is extremely sensitive, especially in the presence of
measurement error. Perhaps a larger issue is one that pertains to fair allocation to cities. Percentile
ranking artificially deflates the impact measurements where a census tract is an outlier. This is
especially consequential for cities such as San Francisco where the city may regulate most pollution
burdens such as pesticides, solid waste, cleanup sites, ozone, and PM2.5, but that there are census

tracts within the city that are outliers for other measures.

2.3.2 Measurement error

Measuring incidence of disease is highly variable, especially for spatially granular units such as census
tracts. Health estimates used in CalEnviroScreen are estimated using emergency room visits. The

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also release census tract-level estimates, which uses a

Figure 3.4: Dendrograms from WGCNA HF (left) and control (right) networks. While the number

in g’s neighborhood by the following procedure (see Figure 3.4):

1. For each pathway, we first ranked the neighbors of g by their absolute edge weight (i.e. cor-
relation) to g in both the HF and control networks. This resulted into two ranked lists of g’s

neighbors: HF- and control-network specific.

2. For each gene g, we plotted the number of network neighbors belonging to a curated list of
known HF-relevant pathways from KEGG and Reactome. In this analysis, the number of HF-
relevant neighbors of gene g in each pathway was plotted on the y axis against progressively
arger inclusive neighborhoods. This allowed us to create a distribution of global-HF pathway
relatedness taking both known HF-relevant neighbors as well as their distance from gene g into
account. For example, as shown for MYH7, MYBPC3, and PPP1R3A for the KEGG HCM
athway in Figure 3.5 D-E, there is a steeper rise in the number of HF-relevant neighbors

connected to each gene in the HF network than in the control network.

 

3. For each gene g in each pathway, the difference between the HF network and control network
curves was evaluated using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic (analogous to gene set en-

richment analysis 56) with a Benjamini-Hochberg correction (false discovery rate FDR=0.01).

4. A gene’s GC was then defined as the number of HF-relevant pathways found to be significantly

enriched in such manner.

To compare per-gene perturbations in local connectivity between HF and control networks, we
defined the change in local connectivity metric LC for a gene g used for this purpose was calculated
as follows: LC(g) = degnorm(9, HF net) — degnorm(g, Control net)

CHAPTER 3. METHODS IN PRECISION HEALTH 49

Finally, central coordinators increased both in GC and LC, and therefore represent genes with
increased local co-expression involving an increased number of global HF-relevant processes.

After classifying each gene in this way, we focused on central coordinators (Figure 3.5B, top
right) in order to capture those genes with the most dynamic connectivity in disease. In addition to
increased connectivity with HF-relevant pathways in the HF versus control networks, these central
coordinators were enriched in OMIM/KEGG cardiomyopathy terms and pathways (hypertrophic
and dilated cardiomyopathy KEGG pathway and OMIM terms, Fisher exact test p-values < 0.001).
This includes the myosin binding protein C3 (MYBPC3) which has previously been implicated in
the Mendelian cardiac muscle diseases, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy
[20, 124] (Figure 3.5B). Particularly, we noted that genes with highest increases in global con-
nectivity regulated HF-related pathways across several cardiomyocyte-relevant processes including
metabolism, muscle contraction, and cardiomyopathy-related genes (Figure 3.5C). These data are
in concordance with transcriptomic data from murine myocardium with and without exposure to
transaortic constriction, which revealed prevalent gene modules associated with mitochondrial and
cytoskeletal gene ontologies [86]. In contrast, prioritization by differential gene expression between
failing and control myocardium did not reveal many genes genetically associated with known car-
diovascular disease pathways. We found no relationship between differential expression and either
global or local differential connectivity. Only 1 of the top 20 highly differentially expressed genes
was associated with cardiovascular disease pathways in KEGG or Reactome compared to 5 out of
the top 20 for the connectivity-derived list — a significant enrichment difference [Fisher exact test
p-value < 0.001], Figure 3.1).

Among those central coordinators whose network connectivity was maximally changed in the
failing heart was protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 3A (PPP1R3A), with one of the highest
changes in GC between control and failing hearts (green typeface, Figure 3.5B)). PPP1R3A, which
encodes a muscle-specific regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)[76], has not been previ-
ously associated with HF. To examine the importance of PPP1R3A to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy
across cardiomyopathic etiologies, we also examined its importance in a cardiomyopathy pathway
(hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, KEGG), and found that its differential connectivity to this path-
way (Figure 3.5D) exceeded even that of MYH7 (Figure 3.5E), an exemplar cardiomyopathy gene.
Additionally, we noted that connectivity of PPP1R3A to our lists of sarcomeric and contraction
genes was increased significantly in HF (Figure 3.7B). Previous work indicates PPP1R3A contains
a glycogen-binding domain [98] and is thought to promote skeletal muscle glycogen synthesis, and
variants in PPP1R3A have been associated with decreased insulin sensitivity [51],[116]. Our own
networks showed increased connectivity of PPP1R3A to metabolic pathways in control and failing
myocardium as well (Figure 3.6B and 3.5C). As cardiac metabolism in HF is known to switch toward
a glucose-based metabolism, and as metabolic pathways were significantly connected to PPPIR3A

in our HF network (Figure 3.5C), we hypothesized that this gene would play an important role in
