ABSTRACT

ARTICLE HISTORY

Big geo-data are often aggregated according to spatio-temporal
units for analyzing human activities and urban environments. Many
applications categorize such data into groups and compare the
characteristics across groups. The intergroup differences vary with
spatio-temporal units, and the essential is to identify the spatiotemporal units with apparently different data characteristics.
However, spatio-temporal dependence, data variety, and the com­
plexity of tasks impede an effective unit assessment. Inspired by the
applications to extract critical image components based on explain­
able artificial intelligence (XAI), we propose a spatio-temporal layerwise relevance propagation method to assess spatio-temporal units
as a general solution. The method organizes input data into an
extensible three-dimensional tensor form. We provide two means
of labeling the spatio-temporal tensor data for typical geographical
applications, using temporally or spatially relevant information.
Neural network training proceeds to extract the global and local
characteristics of data for corresponding analytical tasks. Then the
method propagates classification results backward into units as
obtained task-specific importance. A case study with taxi trajectory
data in Beijing validates the method. The results prove that the
proposed method can evaluate the task-specific importance of
spatio-temporal units with dependence. This study also attempts
to discover task-related knowledge using XAI.

1. Introduction
The characteristics of many geographical phenomena change constantly. Big geo-data
record variation information so that they are widely used to represent human activity
patterns, environmental characteristics, and the mechanisms of natural–human sys­
tems (Ratti et al. 2006, Liu et al. 2015, Ma et al. 2015b, Li et al. 2016). Using preset
resolutions and spatio-temporal tags within records, we can map the big geo-data to
individual spatio-temporal units and then integrate them as tessellations composed of
units; for example, time series (Pei et al. 2014, Wu et al. 2020), spatial distribution

(Zhang et al. 2018b), spatial panel data (An et al. 2015), and spatio-temporal tensor
data (STTD, c.f. the definition in Section 2.1). For specific applications, we acquire the
knowledge by extracting the intergroup differences of data, such as the daily trip
volume distribution in different weather conditions. It is natural that the importance
measures of units are different due to spatio-temporal heterogeneity. We need to pay
more attention to the units with greater importance (e.g., poorly drained zones in the
previously-mentioned case). The unit task-specific importance denotes the contribu­
tion of the corresponding unit’s characteristics to the task. Task-specific spatiotemporal unit assessment is not only beneficial for guiding further studies but also
for discovering task-related knowledge (Lapuschkin et al. 2019), although few existing
studies have focused on this topic.
It is not easy to evaluate the task-specific importance of spatio-temporal units. First, we
should consider the spatio-temporal dependence (Tobler 1970, Cheng et al. 2012, Gao
2015) between units in assessments, indicating that methods based on the assumption of
independent variables, such as sensitivity analysis (Homma and Saltelli 1996, Saltelli 2002),
are not applicable. Second, units’ importance changes depending on tasks, even for the
same experimental data, task-related knowledge is thus necessary. For instance, regard­
ing human activity data, daytime is more valuable than nighttime in most studies (e.g., in
traffic management), because people are more active during the daytime. Conversely,
nighttime may be more crucial in criminal research. For traditional geographical research,
most classic spatio-temporal analyses consider the dependence between units, such as
kernel density analysis (Silverman 1986), spatio-temporal clustering (Birant and Kut 2007),
and local measures of spatial autocorrelation (Anselin 1995). The traditional research
procedure is always highly specialized for task-related knowledge extraction, and part
of the extracted knowledge (e.g., Global Moran’s I) does not correspond to individual
spatio-temporal units; therefore, a general method for task-specific unit assessment is
desirable.
Deep learning (Hinton et al. 2006, Hinton and Salakhutdinov 2006) has been applied to
various geographical studies due to its excellent performance and general applicability
(Huang et al. 2018, Zang et al. 2018, Allam and Dhunny 2019, Reichstein et al. 2019, Li and
Hsu 2020). Meanwhile, computer vision studies have proved that trained neural networks
can extract the critical components of images for classification tasks (Zhang et al. 2018a,
Xie et al. 2019). To address the two assessment difficulties mentioned earlier, specific
neural networks (e.g., convolutional neural networks [CNN] and recurrent neural networks
[RNN] (LeCun et al. 2015, Schmidhuber 2015)) can capture the spatio-temporal depen­
dence between units. Model training can acquire the task-related knowledge and impli­
citly record it in network parameters. In contrast to classic methods of geographical
research, we always regard neural network models as the ‘black box’ (i.e., the acquired
knowledge is implicit) (Erhan et al. 2009). To interpret neural network models, researchers
propose several explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods (Montavon et al. 2018,
Protas et al. 2018, Samek et al. 2019), such as the deconvolution method (Zeiler and
Fergus 2014), layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) algorithm (Bach et al. 2015, Samek
et al. 2017), and class activation mapping (CAM) (Zhou et al. 2016, Selvaraju et al. 2017),
thus providing us with a reference for applying XAI methods to the task-specific assess­
ment of spatio-temporal units.

In this study, we propose a general spatio-temporal layer-wise relevance propagation
(ST-LRP) method to evaluate task-specific importance of spatio-temporal units based on
XAI. The method input data are in an extensible STTD form. For typical geographical
applications, we label the STTD according to temporally- and spatially-relevant informa­
tion. After model training, the method can propagate the acquired task-related knowl­
edge back into individual spatio-temporal units as the obtained units’ importance.
Section 2 explains the definition of concepts, the basic principles of the LRP algorithm,
and the procedure of the proposed ST-LRP method. We use taxi trajectory data in Beijing
as a case study (Section 3). The objective is to assess spatio-temporal units for the task to
distinguish between pick-up patterns on weekdays and weekends/holidays. Section 3 also
gives the analysis of results in spatio-temporal dimensions. We verify the proposed
method from four perspectives (i.e., rationality, task-specific assessment, unit depen­
dence, and data compression) (Section 4). Section 5 summarizes the conclusions and
suggests future research.

2. Methodology
2.1. Basic concepts
Figure 1 demonstrates the STTD (input data form) organization and related concepts used
for this research. Spatio-temporal tensor data is a way of organizing various types of
spatio-temporal data, such as human activity data (e.g., check-in data and taxi trajectory
data) and remote sensing images. We use the word tensor to express the multidimensional nature of data, resembling the multi-dimensional array in computer science
(De Lathauwer 1997). Several previous studies have defined the concept of STTD (Shi et al.
2015, Zhou et al. 2015a). Although the axes of the tensors differed in these studies, they
nevertheless reflect the temporal variation of spatial information (e.g., the time series of
spatial distributions). In this study, three axes (i.e., spatial axes P and Q and temporal axis T)
compose the STTD structure. The three axes are similar to the space-time cube
(Hägerstraand 1970) structure, except that the three-dimensional space is divided into
spatio-temporal units (i.e., the elements of the tensor). The unit scale is fixed for the

spatio-temporal units, while a deeper color indicates a higher contribution value.

experimental data and set according to experience. The target of this study is the unit
assessment of STTD, aiming to evaluate the task-specific importance of each unit (the
assessment result can be visualized as a heatmap as defined by Bach et al. (2015)).
According to the ST-LRP method, the obtained task-specific importance of units repre­
sents their contribution values (with the values being quantitative and comparable) for
accomplishing the classification task and determining the element weight to be used in
other, related applications. The spatial importance and the temporal importance refer to
the spatial and temporal distribution of contribution values, respectively, which can be
extracted based on the obtained units’ importance (illustrated in Figure 3).

2.2. LRP algorithm and the change needed to assess spatio-temporal units
The LRP algorithm (Bach et al. 2015) is a common method of explaining neural networks.
Compared with other XAI methods, such as CAM (Zhou et al. 2016, Selvaraju et al. 2017),
LRP can extract the contribution value of each pixel layer-by-layer, without utilizing a class
activation map (as defined by Zhou et al. (2016)) upsampling process; hence, we apply the
LRP algorithm to geographical studies and propose an ST-LRP method to assess spatiotemporal units. The basic function of the LRP algorithm is to propagate the relevance
score (i.e., the element value sum of the model output) backward, with a conservation law
for each layer, represented by eqs. (1) and (2).

). The relevance is divided into components according to the value of
a � w and then propagated to neurons in the previous layer. Figure 2 illustrates an over­
view of the LRP algorithm. After model training, the method can extract the assessment
result for each input by one forward pass and one backward pass.

For applying the LRP algorithm to the assessment of spatio-temporal units, we empha­
size three points: First, we separately calculate the propagated relevance by the negative
and positive components of a � w in this study and only retain the positive component
(Bach et al. 2015), because the meaning of the obtained units’ importance with negative
values is unclear. Second, the relative locations of the spatial or temporal units are fixed

for each input. For traditional image classification tasks, the input data must be diverse to
improve model capability, but in this study, we can gather the result of each input
according to its fixed unit location, making the assessment results more stable and
reliable. In several cases, we simply investigate one of the spatial and temporal dimen­
sions, so that the relative locations of units in another dimension can be changed. Section
2.3 explains the details. Last, the task-related knowledge learned by neural networks must
be reasonable, meaning that the trained model should have excellent performance and

where Y^ is the predicted label of the corresponding input X, HST is the unit assessment
result of the ST-LRP method, and N is the total sample number for the experimental data.
The sum operation for each sample’s H is the tensor addition (i.e., the sum of correspond­
ing terms in the tensor, with the result size being the same as that of each input). The
extracted HST reflects the task-specific contribution value of each spatio-temporal unit. By
focusing on the investigation of spatial and temporal dimensions separately, we can
extract the spatial importance HS and the temporal importance HT easily, as shown in
Figure 3, merely by summing the values of corresponding units based on the extracted
HST . In the corresponding dimension, the sizes of HS and HT are the same as HST . For HS
and HT extraction, the spatial or temporal unit relative locations for each input have to be
fixed.

2.3. Procedure of the ST-LRP method
Figure 4 illustrates the proposed four-step ST-LRP procedure (i.e., data organization, data
labeling, model training, and unit assessment). We train the neural network models to
acquire task-specific spatio-temporal knowledge based on the labeled STTD input, then
utilize the LRP to assess spatio-temporal units.
First, we organize the spatio-temporal data, such as human activity data and remote
sensing images, into an STTD form (details in Section 2.1) to provide model inputs. It is
worth mentioning that the dimension number for STTD is adjustable. We treat the data
composed of spatio-temporal units (e.g., time series, spatial distribution, and highdimensional data) as a multi-dimensional array (De Lathauwer 1997) and handle it by
the customized neural network structure. For human activity data (e.g., check-in data
and taxi trajectory data), we must reasonably select the geographical units and time
intervals, based on the geographical area and the time range of the research data
(Openshaw and Taylor 1979, Wu et al. 2020). A statistical method based on the spatiotemporal tagging of records is effective for obtaining the activity volume distribution.
We select regular grids as the geographical units for this study, to make the model

training more convenient, although we can handle the data organized according to
irregular geographical units by the graph convolutional neural network (GCN) (Zhu et al.
2020). For remote sensing images, we can apply the raster format directly by CNN
(Huang et al. 2018) and resize images to match the input size requirement (Zhang et al.
2016); hence, we only need to organize the images, which have the same spatial range
but different collection time, as one image with multi-bands (i.e., time series). We can
use the resampling method to match images with different resolutions. If remote
sensing images already have multi-bands in the spectral dimension, we can use the STLRP method to assess these data and determine their spectral importance. The
unchanged STTD size is important for data labeling and model training for a specific
task. To ensure that the assessment result is understandable, the relative unit location
for each input should remain unchanged in at least one spatial and temporal
dimensions.
Second, we label the STTD input to model training according to its temporal or spatial
information. To evaluate the task-specific importance of units in the spatial dimension, we
should label the STTD input according to its temporal information, such as the season,
whether daytime or nighttime, and the information relating to the task (e.g., before or
after the events that are of interest, such as specific policy-making, subway operations,
and extreme weather). In this case, the relative locations of spatial units must be fixed for
each input. We can see the input as a slice of time series for the study area. To assess units
in the temporal dimension, we should label the STTD input according to its spatial
information, such as the land use type, the congestion degree, and the suburb or down­
town location. We fix the relative locations of temporal units in this case and see each
input as a component of spatial distributions with the same temporal bands. The STTD

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE

labeling is customized according to the task and the information contained in the
research data.
Third, we train a neural network model based on the labeled STTD. In this study, the
neural network is composed of fully-connected and convolutional layers that can capture
the unit dependence. In several studies, RNN and long short-term memory (LSTM) net­
works (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber 1997) have proved to have excellent prediction
performance for the temporal dimension (Ma et al. 2015a, Yu et al. 2017). We can also
apply the LSTM in this study for specific applications (Samek et al. 2019). The network
structure (e.g., the depth and the layer order) and the training time depend on the
training data volume and the complexity of the classification task. The model training
process aims to acquire task-related spatio-temporal knowledge, which can then be used
in the unit assessment process. This means that the training parameter (e.g., kernel size)
setting should be rational, and the trained model must be accurate enough (e.g., classi­
fication accuracy greater than 90%). The model training is independent for different tasks,
guaranteeing that the result is task-specific to certain situations, even for the same input.
Last, we use the LRP algorithm to assess spatio-temporal units after the model training.
Section 2.2 introduces the LRP details. We should extract the contribution values of
spatio-temporal units first, then sum the unit values for the corresponding dimension
to determine their spatial and temporal importance. The normalization of results is
recommended for any subsequent visualization and analysis.

3. Case study: unit assessment for the task of distinguishing between
human activity data for weekdays and weekends/holidays
To validate the proposed ST-LRP method, we conduct a case study based on human
activity data. Taxicabs are the common transport mode in urban areas. As a proxy for total
citizen trips, taxi trajectory data that record human activities with spatio-temporal infor­
mation, have been widely applied due to their simple data collection method (through
the GPS sensors in taxis) (Zheng et al. 2011). Moreover, previous studies have utilized
spatio-temporal patterns of taxi movements and origin and destination point (OD)
volumes to support the understanding of urban environments (Liu et al. 2012, 2016,
2018, Zhou et al. 2015b). Hence we extract OD points from raw taxi trajectories for this
study. The spatial distribution of the origin points is time-varied, reflecting the travel
demands of residents. This case study aims to assess spatio-temporal units for the
classification task of distinguishing the origin point volume distribution on weekdays
and weekends/holidays, which will be beneficial for understanding the spatio-temporal
patterns of pick-up behaviors and provide a reference for taxi dispatching and the design
of pick-up areas.

3.1. Description of the study area and data
We choose a square region located approximately within the 5th ring road in Beijing as
the study area (Figure 5), with an area of 900km2 divided into 30 � 30 1km2 grid squares
as the geographical units for the experiment. The experimental data are the taxi trajectory
data collected for the whole of 2016 in Beijing, provided by an anonymous taxi company
using data masking. Record fields include taxi ID, Universal Time Coordinated (UTC),

location information, and the taxi status (i.e., whether empty or occupied) at specific
sampling moments. We extract the trips based on status changes and only record the
information for the origin and destination points. After data filtering (the criteria for which
related to trips with an average speed of less than 120km=h and a trip distance greater
than 100 meters), the total number of valid trips was 89,559,065. Based on the extracted
taxi OD data, origin point volume distributions are generated statistically, using a 1km2
grid square spatial resolution and a half-hour temporal resolution. We organize the data
for one day as STTD with a size of 30 � 30 � 48. The spatial units’ relative locations are
unchanged in each sample, meaning that we can extract the spatial importance after the
model training. Although the temporal units are different (drawn from different days) for
each input, previous studies have identified the daily periodicity of the taxi origin point
volume (Liu et al. 2012); hence, we can also examine the temporal importance.

3.2. Neural network building and training
This case study aims to assess spatio-temporal units for the classification task of distin­
guishing between human activity data (in STTD form) for weekdays and weekends/holi­
days. We label the organized STTD according to two temporal categories (i.e., weekday or
weekend/holiday) with one-hot encoding, based on the 2016 Chinese public holiday
schedule.1 We build a neural network to identify the labeled data and acquire the taskrelated spatio-temporal knowledge. For different experimental data and applications, the
network structure and parameters can be adjusted to achieve excellent classification
performance. Figure 6 illustrates the neural network structure for this study. The network
includes three convolutional layers (Conv) and two fully-connected layers (FC). After each
Conv (the kernel size is 5 for Conv_1 and 4 for the others, and the stride is 1 for each Conv),
the feature map (i.e., the output of each layer) size is reduced by max-pooling. We develop
the program based on the previous LRP work2 (Lapuschkin et al. 2016).
The processed data cover a total of 363 days (with three days of missing data), 249 of
which are weekdays and the other 114 days are weekends/holidays. We randomly select

the training set and validation set equally from two categories (with the resulting
numbers being 128 and 100). After 200 batches of model training, the classification
accuracies of the validation set and the total data are 98% and 98.9%, respectively,
which is sufficiently high for the subsequent unit assessment. To further verify the
model capability, we also process the Beijing taxi data collected from January to
March 2017 as a test set (50 samples). Classification accuracy is still 98% for the test set,
indicating that the model can distinguish the taxi origin point volume distribution for the
study area whether this is on weekdays or not.

3.3. Unit assessment and result interpretation from both spatial and temporal
dimensions
We obtain the unit contribution value distribution for each input based on the trained
neural network and the LRP algorithm. To ensure that the results are valid, we retain the
input data with the correct classified label (adding up to 359 days) for the unit assessment,
as mentioned in eq. (5). Figure 7 illustrates the extracted spatial and temporal importance.
To investigate the contribution of each spatio-temporal unit for global research, we use
the sum normalization method to reflect the contribution proportion. We sort the units
according to their contribution values, from the highest to the lowest, and highlight the
‘important’ time slots and zones for which the contribution accumulative proportion
(CAP) is higher than 60%. Important time slots are continuous and cover the period
from 8:00 to 17:30, which is approximately the duration of working hours for most people
in Beijing (i.e., from 9:00 to 17:00). In terms of spatial importance, north Beijing has
a higher contribution value than south Beijing, probably due to the unbalanced economic
level and human activity intensity between north and south. The important zones are
contiguous, except for a few isolated grids, and zones with great importance are dis­
tributed around roads such as the 3rd ring road, consistent with the areas in which taxis
are normally used.
To compare the extracted importance distribution differences between human activity
data for weekdays and weekends/holidays, we separately calculate the temporal and

spatial importance of the two categories, based on correct classified samples. Figure 8
illustrates the unit contribution values normalized by the min-max normalization method.
In terms of the temporal importance of both categories, daytime has a higher contribu­
tion value than nighttime, which is realistic because people are seldom active at night in
either temporal category. The contribution value distribution for weekend/holiday iden­
tification is relatively dispersed, especially from 16:00 to 22:00, which is typical weekend
shopping and entertainment time for most people. In terms of the spatial importance of
the two categories, the contribution value distribution for weekend/holiday identification
is more concentrated, which is opposite to the temporal pattern. In general, the contribu­
tion value distributions for the two categories are similar in both the temporal and spatial
dimensions, probably because we train the network to handle binary classification (i.e.,
identify a sample as the first category, which is equivalent to identify the sample as not
the second category). Units with large differences between the two categories are valu­
able for data identification in both categories.
To explain the assessment results for spatio-temporal units, we calculate the sample
means of the 2016 data, which reflects the distribution of the average origin point
volumes. The correlation between the volume and the contribution values is investigated
using linear regression analysis and illustrated in Figure 9. Figure 9(a) shows that the
contribution value of each spatio-temporal unit can be 71.2% (R2 ¼ 0:712; p < 0:001)
explained by the corresponding volume. In other words, the units with larger origin
point volumes may have been more crucial for the classification task. This is reasonable
because units with large data volumes are essential in most cases (e.g., rush hour in traffic
research and shopping mall in studies of human activities). Also, there appeared to be
multiple relationships between the activity volumes and the contribution values, as
shown in Figure 9(a). To further investigate these relationships, correlations between
the volume and contribution values for the temporal and spatial dimensions are deter­
mined and illustrated in Figure 9(b, c). Figure 9(b) shows that the contribution values can
be 99.0% (R2 ¼ 0:990; p < 0:001) explained by corresponding volumes in the temporal

dimension. Compared with the temporal dimension, the contribution values can be 70.3%
(R2 ¼ 0:703; p < 0:001) explained by the volumes in the spatial dimension, probably
influenced by the complexity of spatial activity patterns, which are difficult to express
using simple indexes such as activity volume. Figure 9(c) indicates three specific zones
with obviously high contribution values relative to their activity volumes. Querying the
zones by the location information, we find that Zones A, B, and C are the approximate
areas around Beijing West Railway Station, Beijing South Railway Station, and Beijing
Nanyuan Airport, respectively. All the three zones are the transportation junctions in
Beijing, which is reflected by the fact that the taxi pick-ups for the transportation junctions
vary for the two categories (i.e., weekdays and weekends/holidays). Most people go for
inter-city trips on weekends/holidays and, when they arrive at the destination city, will
usually take a taxi from the airport/railway station to their booked hotels, especially in
areas with underdeveloped public transport. This highlights the pattern difference

between the two categories and proves that the model has learned the knowledge to
distinguish between the two categories of data.
The sample mean can reflect the overall pattern of data in traditional studies; hence,
units with a large mean volume difference between the two categories are probably
crucial for the classification task. To demonstrate this, we conduct a regression analysis of
the contribution values and the absolute volume differences of spatio-temporal units
(Figure 9[d]). It shows an inadequate explanation (R2 ¼ 0:448; p < 0:001) between the two
variables, meaning that the network has learned the task-related knowledge, which is
more complicated than the volume difference between the two categories. Figure 9(e)
and (f) show correlations between the contribution values and the absolute volume
differences in the temporal and spatial dimensions. Similar to the previous result, the
explanation is strong (R2 ¼ 0:862; p < 0:001) in the temporal dimension and weak
(R2 ¼ 0:484; p < 0:001) in the spatial dimension. Compared with the correlations in
Figure 9(b) and (c), correlations between the contribution values and the absolute volume
differences are weaker in both the temporal and spatial dimensions, indicating that the
trained neural network model has learned the relevant knowledge, which is more com­
plicated than the absolute volume differences in both the temporal and spatial dimen­
sions. This occurs because the model has considered the spatio-temporal dependence of
the units and processes spatio-temporal units together. The convolutional layer can
extract the local and global characteristics of human activity data.

4. Validation and discussion
4.1. Validation of the unit assessment results
To validate the unit assessment results, we perform extra experiments on the same
input data with different methods. Taking the spatial importance validation as an
example, we replace several zones’ values in the study area and evaluate the model
accuracy variation. The more the model accuracy decreases, the more the zones are
crucial for the classification task (Zeiler and Fergus 2014, Samek et al. 2017). We first sort
the 900 zones in the study area by their extracted contribution values, from the highest
to the lowest, then construct nine groups based on the CAPs. Table 1 displays the details
such as the number of zones, which shows that the contribution values for the task are
concentrated in a few spatial units (the CAPs of only 43% of the spatial units are higher
than 90%).
A common way of handling the missing data problem in geographical studies is to
interpolate it using the surrounding values; therefore, we replace the zone value with 48
temporal elements for each input by calculating the corresponding mean value of eight
spatial neighborhoods. In addition to the contribution value order, two baselines for
comparison are the zone’s replacement by the zone volume, from the largest to the
smallest, and replacement of the random zones. In the contrast experiment, the way to
replace is as mentioned (i.e., interpolation), and the number of replaced zones is also the
same as that displayed in Table 1. Figure 10 illustrates the variation in model accuracy
according to the mentioned validation set (50 samples for each category). It is worth
mentioning that the accuracy is determined by the mean value of 50 experiments for the
random replacement. As shown in Figure 10, the more zones that are replaced, the more

the model accuracy decreases for the replacement methods overall, meaning that repla­
cing zone values affect the classification capability of the model. For the experiment with
the randomly-replaced zones, the model accuracy is still higher than 80%, even when 43%
of the zones are replaced, proving that the trained neural network model is robust and the
interpolation method is reasonable. For the two other experiments, the model accuracy
based on the contribution value order is smaller than the one based on the volume order
overall, especially when replacing more than 30% of zones. When the replaced zone
proportion reaches 43% (CAP higher than 90%), the model accuracy for the contribution
value experiment is close to the baseline of 50% (i.e., random classification) for the binary
classification. However, the model accuracy for the volume experiment is still higher than
70% in the same situation, reflecting that a zone with a high contribution value is essential
to the classification task, and the proposed ST-LRP method is effective.

4.2. Task-specific assessment results
We train the neural network model to distinguish between human activity data for
weekdays and weekends/holidays. For each sample, the classification rule of the trained
model is to choose the label with the highest element value in the corresponding output
(two elements), but the sample can have characteristics of both the two categories.
Therefore, we select nine samples from the complete data according to the rule that
both the element values for the corresponding output are higher than one. These
samples’ dates always fall on weekends but working day due to the holiday arrangement
in Beijing (e.g., 2 February 2016). This explains why these samples have characteristics of
both categories. To further compare the unit assessment results for the two categories, we
evaluate the unit importance for the specific category by changing the relevance score
(Figure 2) in the LRP algorithm (Zhang et al. 2016). The neural network output (i.e., the
classified label) can be changed to ½1; 0� or ½0; 1� as the LRP input, and then the corre­
sponding single category information will be retained. For nine selected samples, Figure
11 illustrates the mean spatial contribution value difference between the two categories,
based on the same sample. To analyze the difference, we divide unit contribution values
into two parts (i.e., positive and negative) and normalize them separately using the minmax normalization method (the maximum is 2:69 � 10 4 , and the minimum
is 7:64 � 10 4 ).
As shown in Figure 11, the distribution pattern difference between the positive
and negative contribution values is obvious. Spatial units with higher contribution

classified labels. The units with positive values reflect that the extracted contribution values with

values for the identification of weekdays are located in the northeast of Beijing,
whereas units located in southwest Beijing have relatively high contribution values
for the identification of weekends/holidays. The differences between the assessment
results reflect that the unit assessment not only relies on the sample itself but also
relies on the task. To further investigate the contribution value differences, we
conduct a multiple linear regression analysis based on Beijing POI (points of interest)
data (collected in 2015 and provided by Baidu, a Chinese company). The contribution
value difference ( � 108 to avoid the calculating error from computer store precision)
of units is the dependent variable for the regression analysis. The independent
variables are the POI counts of different types located in the corresponding unit.
To avoid the multicollinearity of independent variables, we calculate the Spearman
rank correlation coefficient between variables and remove the variable with a strong
correlation (0:8 or greater). We use the ordinary least squares method of the stats­
model package (Seabold and Perktold 2010) for the multiple linear regression. The R2
is 0.213 for the regression, suggesting that various types of POI counts can explain
only 20% of the contribution value difference information. Table 2 displays the
regression results for the independent variables. Only four types of POIs (i.e., enter­
tainment, government, life services, and transportation) significantly correlate with the
contribution value difference. These results indicate that government (with a positive
coefficient) tends to increase the contribution value of weekday identifications and
the other three (entertainment, life services, and transportation) tend to benefit week­
end/holiday identifications. This is consistent with the lifestyles of residents. This
experiment proves that the assessed result is task-specific and the trained model
has learned the knowledge necessary to identify the data category.

4.3. Comparison with methods without considering unit dependence
The proposed ST-LRP method considers the spatio-temporal dependence among units.
To demonstrate this point, we use the random forest algorithm to assess units based on
the same data. The random forest algorithm is one of the most popular machine learning
methods for classification tasks (Breiman 2001). This method assumes that elements are
independent. We can extract each element’s importance after model training according
to the element order of building the decision tree. In this experiment, we implement the

random forest model by the public machine learning package: scikit-learn (Pedregosa
et al. 2011). To control the element number and the model performance, we train the
random forest model separately to evaluate the temporal and spatial importance of units.
The training data are the same as that used for the above experiment (i.e., training set),
but the sizes are changed to 48 and 30 � 30 by aggregation in the spatial and temporal
dimensions, respectively. After the model training, the random forest algorithm achieves
the same classification performance level as the neural network model (accuracies are
97.8% and 98.7% for the two dimensions). Figure 12 displays the temporal and spatial
importance (the mean values for 50 experiments) evaluated by the random forest
algorithm.
In terms of temporal importance, daytime is more crucial than nighttime, consistent
with the results from the ST-LRP. The changing patterns of importance are different,
especially in terms of continuity. The pattern for temporal importance evaluated by the
random forests shows fluctuations; for example, the time slot of 7:00–7:30 has the great­
est importance, but the next time slot of 7:30–8:00 has small importance. This is irrational
and difficult to explain but may be caused by the consideration of each time slot
individually. As a contrast, the ST-LRP method regards time slots as multi-bands and
processes them together. In terms of spatial importance, zones with great importance are
discontinuous and only a few zones contribute to classification; by contrast, zones with
great spatial importance evaluated by ST-LRP (Figure 7[b]) are distributed continuously
and concentrated in the urban center or near the main roads. The contrast experiment
using random forests proves that the unit dependence, which is necessary for the spatiotemporal unit assessment, have been considered by the ST-LRP method.

4.4. Application of the obtained importance
The obtained task-specific importance of time slots and zones can guide our focus on the
essential spatio-temporal units. It can also be used to reduce the data element number for

practical applications. We accomplish an application of spectral clustering, based on the
temporal activity signatures of taxi origin point volumes, to assess the effectiveness of the
obtained importance (taking temporal importance as an example) in data compression.
The experimental data are the same as those mentioned in Section 3.1. The temporal
activity signature for each zone has 48 elements. We reduce the element number to 20 in
the contrast experiment according to the obtained temporal importance (‘important’ time
slots) displayed in Figure 7(a). The clustering divides the study area into several regions.
The more similar the spatial distribution of two clustering results, the more effective the
data compression. Figure 13 illustrates the spatial distributions for the two sets of results
and the differences between them. We carry out these experiments by the scikit-learn
package (Pedregosa et al. 2011) with the same model parameters, such as the cluster
number (three for both), and color the zone according to its cluster label. As shown in
Figure 13, the two distributions are similar, suggesting that we can apply the obtained
temporal importance to data compression. Only 44 (4.89%) zones highlighted in Figure 13
(c) have different cluster labels in the two experiments. Most are located in the boundary
region of the study area. The clustering difference may be caused by the low data volume
for these zones. The experiment proves that the assessment result is valuable for data
compression applications.

5. Conclusions
An individual unit's data reflect the object characteristics in a given spatio-temporal
ranges. The importance measures of spatio-temporal units are different for specific
applications. This research develops an ST-LRP method for evaluating task-specific impor­
tance of spatio-temporal units based on XAI. The assessment results represent taskrelated knowledge for further studies regarding critical spatio-temporal units and use it
for various applications, such as data compression. This method has merits in each step.
First, we can adjust the input data structure (i.e., of the STTD) for different types of

has different labels in the two results. The spatial range is the same as the study area illustrated in
Figure 5. For convenience, we omit the legend, the north arrow, and the plotting scale.

research data (e.g., human activity data and remote sensing images). Second, we can label
the research data by temporal or spatial related information for typical geographical
applications and extract the task-specific results. Third, the neural network structure
and training parameters are customized to achieve excellent performance. Global and
local characteristics (e.g., unit dependence) can be automatically captured by the specific
structure (e.g., the convolutional layer) during the model training process. Last, the XAI
method can extract the contribution value (i.e., the task-specific importance) for each
original spatio-temporal unit based on the trained model. Assessment for a single unit is
beneficial to the subsequent analysis.
The case study is based on the taxi data of Beijing. The spatio-temporal distribution of
origin point volumes serves as the input for the model training. In the task of distinguish­
ing between data for weekdays and weekends/holidays, we display and analyze the unit
assessment results according to the temporal and spatial dimensions. For this classifica­
tion task, the daytime is more crucial than the nighttime, and the zones with high
contribution values are concentrated in the urban area and near the main road.
Moreover, four extra experiments validate the ST-LRP method. The results convince us
that the assessment is rational, task-specific, and valuable for data compression applica­
tions, and that the method has considered the unit dependence.
Compared with the traditional studies on spatio-temporal units, the proposed approach is
general rather than specialized in method selection. For example, we can use the spatiotemporal kernel density estimation, which is one of the classic spatio-temporal analysis
methods, to detect hot spots of human activities instead of change detection studies. In
contrast, the ST-LRP method is also suitable forthese two kinds of applications. For example, if
we train the model to recognize traffic conditions based on vehicle speed distributions, the
obtained spatial importance can indicate congested areas (i.e., hot spots) and guide traffic
management. For change detection, the modified rule is to find essential units that contribute
to distinguish between two categories of distributions, such as land-use change detection
based on remote sensing data collected in different years or road network evolution analysis
based on fundamental annual urban geographical data for the same city. Moreover, in future
research, we intend to focus on semi-automatic model training to save time on network
design and then improve the ST-LRP method for more valuable applications.
Several points about XAI are worth discussing. Due to their excellent performance,
artificial intelligence (AI) methods have developed rapidly and been widely applied. In
several applications, such as image classification and games, the performance of AI
methods exceeds that of humans (Silver et al. 2016, Samek et al. 2019). However, it is
not enough to merely apply black-box AI methods. Recent studies have focused on
explaining models and then acquiring new task-related knowledge (Lapuschkin et al.
2019, Gahegan 2020). The knowledge captured by AI methods is valuable and can guide
humans regarding corresponding tasks. The proposed ST-LRP method based on XAI can
be used to acquire knowledge in geographical studies and inspire further research on
model explanation for GeoAI (Janowicz et al. 2020) applications.
