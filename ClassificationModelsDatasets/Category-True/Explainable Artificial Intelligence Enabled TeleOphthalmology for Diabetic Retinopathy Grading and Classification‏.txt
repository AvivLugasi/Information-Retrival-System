Abstract: Recently, Telehealth connects patients to vital healthcare services via remote monitoring,
wireless communications, videoconferencing, and electronic consults. By increasing access to specialists and physicians, telehealth assists in ensuring patients receive the proper care at the right
time and right place. Teleophthalmology is a study of telemedicine that provides services for eye
care using digital medical equipment and telecommunication technologies. Multimedia computing
with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for telehealth has the potential to revolutionize various
aspects of our society, but several technical challenges should be resolved before this potential can be
realized. Advances in artificial intelligence methods and tools reduce waste and wait times, provide
service efficiency and better insights, and increase speed, the level of accuracy, and productivity
in medicine and telehealth. Therefore, this study develops an XAI-enabled teleophthalmology for
diabetic retinopathy grading and classification (XAITO-DRGC) model. The proposed XAITO-DRGC
model utilizes OphthoAI IoMT headsets to enable remote monitoring of diabetic retinopathy (DR)
disease. To accomplish this, the XAITO-DRGC model applies median filtering (MF) and contrast
enhancement as a pre-processing step. In addition, the XAITO-DRGC model applies U-Net-based
image segmentation and SqueezeNet-based feature extractor. Moreover, Archimedes optimization
algorithm (AOA) with a bidirectional gated recurrent convolutional unit (BGRCU) is exploited for
DR detection and classification. The experimental validation of the XAITO-DRGC method can be
tested using a benchmark dataset and the outcomes are assessed under distinct prospects. Extensive
comparison studies stated the enhancements of the XAITO-DRGC model over recent approaches.

1. Introduction
The term “telemedicine” was defined in the 1970s by Strehle and Shabde as “healing
at a distance”. The World Health Organization (WHO) presented a standard meaning of
telemedicine as “the delivery of health care services, where distance becomes a critical factor,
by every healthcare expert by making use of information and communication technology
(ICT) for interchanging validated data for prognosis, medication and preventing injuries
and disease” [1]. Telemedicine depends on ICT, termed a “different set of technical tools and

sources utilized for creating, transmitting, exchanging or sharing, storing, information [2].
Such resources and technological tools involve live broadcasting technology (television,
webcasting, and radio), recorded broadcasting technology (podcasting, video and audio
players, and memory gadgets), telephony (mobile or fixed, satellite, video-conferencing),
and the internet (emails, websites, and blogs)”. A creative grouping of screening with the
help of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), fundus cameras, and other gadgets with
telemedicine escorted in the period of teleophthalmology can be implemented in non-eye
care backgrounds and in ophthalmology offices, which include primary care workplaces [3].
This can be possible by appropriate follow-up eye care and remote grading. Developing
global interest in the usage of telemedicine in screening for diabetic retinopathy (DR)
caused the emergence of several journals during the past few years [4].
Diabetes mellitus was a very expensive and pandemic chronic ailment. It affects nearly
4.15 billion people across the world, responsible for 12% of the global health expenses, and
even so, 1 in 2 people were untreated and undiagnosed [5]. Subsequently, life-threatening
complexities because of diabetes mellitus, namely cardiomyopathy, neuropathy, strokes,
retinopathy, and nephropathy have hiked across many countries. Today, caregivers and
patients will stay on a query relating to diabetes management [6]. For instance, frequent
diagnoses and offering essential advice for patients in self-management were needed for the
prevention of acute terrible complexities and to reduce the danger of life-long conditions [7].
The surge of a higher volume of real-world data collected at the time of medications has
generated incredible enthusiasm in diabetic care. Among them, imagery reports present a
great effect on developing new insights and disturb the present understanding of diabetic
care. Currently, medical imaging is mostly utilized for diagnosing, prioritizing treatment,
and evaluating replies to medications in modern medicine [8]. The main reason was the
work pressure of a health care professional surges significantly because of a huge number
of patients indulging in population screening and thus, patients are waiting in a lengthy
queue [9]. Artificial intelligence (AI) was increasingly automating health care practices and
provides high precision, satisfaction, and efficiency [10]. With the recent progression in
digitalized data acquisition, machine learning (ML), and computer vision (CV), AI was
diffusing into medical decision-making processes that are formerly scrutinized below the
direct supervising of human professionals.
This study develops an XAI-enabled teleophthalmology for diabetic retinopathy grading and classification (XAITO-DRGC) model. The proposed XAITO-DRGC model uses
median filtering (MF) and contrast enhancement as a pre-processing step. In addition,
the XAITO-DRGC model applies U-Net-based image segmentation and SqueezeNet-based
feature extractor. Moreover, Archimedes optimization algorithm (AOA) with a bidirectional
gated recurrent convolutional unit (BGRCU) is exploited for DR detection and classification. The experimental validation of the XAITO-DRGC model is tested using a benchmark
dataset and the results are assessed under distinct aspects.

Wijesinghe et al. [11] suggest a prototype that includes an independent system named
Intelligent Diabetic Assistant (IDA), that determines the prognosis and the treatment prioritizing relies on the observation manifested on a screen. The IDA comprises a knowledgerelated module for a severity level-related classifier, and clinical decision support. In [12],
an ensemble-based ML method containing ML techniques such as Logistic Regression
(LR), Random Forest (RF), Adaboost, KNN, and Decision Tree (DT) can be tested on the
DR dataset. In the initial step, normalization can be performed on the DR dataset by the
min-max normalization technique. Hacisoftaoglu et al. [13] introduced an automatic DR
detection technique for smartphone-related retinal images by utilizing the DL technique

privacy violation, or data loss.

3.1. Image Pre-Processing
At the initial stage, the XAITO-DRGC model applies MF and contrast enhancement as
a pre-processing step. The MF technique adopts a non-linear approach for noise exclusion
from scaled input images [17]. It functions by sliding pixel by pixel, replacing every pixel
value with a median value of adjacent pixels. The window pattern having a size of 3 × 3 can
be utilized to slide pixel by pixel over the neighbors in a scaled input image. The calculation
of the median is conducted by sorting every pixel value primarily in arithmetical order
in the window paradigm and interchanging the pixel values with the central pixel value.
The histogram equalization technique can be implied for enhancing the contrast of the
scaled input image by making use of its histogram. The procedure is done through the
distribution of pixel intensity values that were appearing frequently and thus, low contrast
regions of an image obtain high contrast.
3.2. Image Segmentation
Next to image pre-processing, the XAITO-DRGC model applies U-Net-based image
segmentation. U-Net is initially established for medicinal image understanding and segmentation [18]. It is a vast application from the area and is an important structure of
the medicinal image automation society. The infrastructure of this network contains two
important parts namely contractive and expansive. The contracting direction contains
many patches of convolutional with a filter of size 3 × 33 × 3 and unity strides from
both paths, then a rectified linear unit (ReLU) layer. This direction extracts the important
features of input and outcomes from a feature vector of a particular length. The second
direction pulls data in the contractive direction using copy and crop, and in the feature
vector using up-convolution creates, with a succeeding function, a resultant segmentation
map. An important element of this structure is the procedure connecting the 1st and 2nd
directions composed. This connection permits the network for attaining extremely accurate
data in the contractive path, creating the segmentation mask nearby the projected outcome.
3.3. Feature Extraction
At this stage, the segmented images are passed into the SqueezeNet model to produce
feature vectors. Generally, the CNN comprises a pooling layer, full connection layer,
and convolutional layer. At first, the feature is extracted using multiple convolutions
and pooling layers. Next, the feature mapping from the final convolutional layers is
transformed into a one-dimensional vector. At last, the output layer classifies the input

3.4. Image Classification
In the final stage, the BGRCU is exploited for DR detection and classification. Gated
recurrent unit (GRU) is making all the recurrent units for adaptably capture dependency of
distinct time scales. Like the long short term memory (LSTM), the GRU is a gate unit that
modulates the flow of data inside the memory [20], but without taking a discrete memory
cell. The input to GRU in step t is D dimension vector xt ∈ RD . The hidden vector sequence
h1T := h1 , . . . , h T was computed as iterating the subsequent formulas in t = 1, . . . , T:
zt = σ (Wz xt + Uz ht−1 + bz )
rt = σ (Wr xt + Ur ht−1 + br )
h = σ (Wh xt + Uh (rt E

h t −1 ) + bh )

h t = (1 − z t ) h t −1 + z t h t
The activation has been collected of the update gate zt , reset gate rt , candidate gate
h, and resultant activation ht . W(•) , U(•) , and b(•) represent the suitable sized matrix and
bias. The symbol σ represents the sigmoid activation and
denotes the elementwise
multiplication. The BiGRU processes data from both directions with forward as well as
backward hidden layers. Related to the unidirectional case the number of free parameters
doubles. The outcome of both directions is then concatenated from the outcome.

with processing the input order in the reverse direction with t = T, . . . , 1. The outcome h1T of BGRU is the step-wise concatenation of forward as well as backward outputs

An input to Gated Recurrent Convolutional Unit (GRCU) with C channel and input

calculated by iterating the subsequent formulas in t = 1, . . . , T:
zt = σ (Wz ∗ xt + pool (Uz ∗ ht−1 ) + bz )
rt = σ (Wr ∗ xt + pool (Ur ∗ ht−1 ) + br )

and U(•) ∈ RF× F× L are F features map of length L. The max-pooling
functions also take length L and b(•) ∈ RF are the bias. The GRCU utilizes a similar gating
infrastructure as the BGRU, then every fully connected (FC) matrix multiplication was
replaced with a convolutional matrix function afterward a max-pooling function with a
similar filter length. Integrating GRCU as well as bidirectional recurrent neural network
(RNN) outcomes from the BGRCU that were determined analogously to BGRU.
In this study, the AOA assists in optimal hyperparameter tuning of the BGRCU model.
AOA is a technique simulated by physics, in further detail Archimedes’ law. This technique
was established by Fatma Hashim in 2020 and goes into the class of meta-heuristics [21].
In the procedure of AOA, the upgrade of density and volume has been recognized for
changing the acceleration dependent upon the collision model amongst objects that play a
vital role from determine a new place of present solutions. The common steps of AOA are
explained as:

Appl. Sci. 2022, 12, 8749

The initialized procedure purposes for initializing arbitrarily the real population which
comprises N objects utilized in Equation (1). Moreover, all the objects are considered as
density ( Di ), volume (Vi ), and acceleration (Γi ) that are randomly determined by the
subsequent equation:


(4)

Let Oi be the ith object, and OiMin and OiMax refers to the maximum and minimum
bounds of the searching space, correspondingly. r1 , r2 , r3 , and r4 denotes random vector
lies between [0, 1] Dim . In the updating of volume and density, the values of density and
volume for every object were upgraded by the control of the optimal density and volume
as follows:

Dit+1 = D t + s1 × DBest − Dit
(5)

Vit+1 = Vit + s2 × VBest − Vit
(6)
From the equation, s1 , s2 refers to numbers lying within zero and one. Next, the collision between objects happened till attaining the equilibrium state. The key role of
the transfer function ( Tc ) is to shift from exploration to exploitation modes, determined
as follows:


t−T
Tc = exp
(7)
T
The Tc exponentially increases over time until obtaining 1. t refers to the existing
iteration, whereas T represents the maximal iteration count. Similarly, the reduction of the
density scalar ds in AOA permits to discover an optimum solution [22]:
  


In the exploration phase, the collision between agents is appeared by randomly selecting material ( Mr ). Therefore, the update of the acceleration object is employed if the
transfer function value was lesser or equivalent to 0.5.
Γit+1 =

D Mr + VMr × Γ Mr
Dit+1 × Vit+1

(9)

In the exploitation, the collision between agents was not realized. Therefore, the update
of the acceleration object can be employed if the transfer coefficient values are higher
than 0.5.

Γit+1 = Best t+1 Best t+1 Best

In Equation (10), Γ Best represents the acceleration of the optimum object OBest . During
normalization, we normalize the acceleration to define the rate of change as follows:

Γri−

In Equation (11), α and β are set as 0.9 and 0.1, correspondingly. Γit−
norm illustrates
the proportion of steps adapted by every agent. A low acceleration value specifies that the
object was working under the exploitation mode; or else, the object was working under
an exploration mode. For the exploration stage ( Tc ≤ 0.5), the location of the ith object in

The AOA method makes a derivation of a fitness function for attaining advanced
classifier performances. It sets a positive numeral for indicating the superior performance
of the candidate solutions. In this article, the reduction of the classifier error rate can be
assumed as the fitness function, as presented below in Equation (15).

4. Experimental Validation
The experimental validation of the XAITO-DRGC model is tested using two datasets.
Table 1 depicts the detailed description of two datasets. The DDR dataset [23] comprises
13,673 fundus images obtained at a 45◦ field of view (FOV). Among these, there were
1151 ungradable images, 6266 normal images, and 6256 DR images. The APTOS 2019
Kaggle dataset [24] has 3662 retina images with various image sizes. The dataset can
be classified into five DR stages. Moreover, 1805 of the images are normal and 1857 are
DR images.

Figure 3 illustrates the confusion matrices given by the XAITO-DRGC model on
the APTOS 2019 dataset. On the entire dataset, the XAITO-DRGC model has identified
344 samples as normal, 59 samples as mild, 188 samples as moderate, 21 samples as severe,
and 42 samples as proliferative. In addition, on 70% of training (TR) data, the XAITO-DRGC
method has identified 243 samples as normal, 43 samples as mild, 132 samples as moderate,
12 samples as severe, and 26 samples as proliferative. Also, on 30% of testing (TS) data,
the XAITO-DRGC technique has identified 101 samples as normal, 16 samples as mild,
56 samples as moderate, 9 samples as severe, and 16 samples as proliferative.

5. Conclusions
In this article, a new XAITO-DRGC technique was projected for the detection and
classification of DR. The presented XAITO-DRGC model utilizes OphthoAI IoMT headsets
to enable remote monitoring of DR disease. Initially, the XAITO-DRGC model applies MF
and contrast enhancement as a pre-processing step. In addition, the XAITO-DRGC model
applies U-Net-based image segmentation and SqueezeNet-based feature extractor. Finally,
AOA with BGRCU is exploited for DR detection and classification where the AOA assist in
optimal hyperparameter tuning of the BGRCU model. The experimental validation of the
XAITO-DRGC technique can be tested using a benchmark dataset and the outcomes were
assessed under distinct prospects. Extensive comparison studies stated the enhancements
of the XAITO-DRGC model over recent approaches with maximum accuracy of 98.24%
whereas the existing CNN512-dropout model has attained reduced accuracy of 84.10%
on the DDR dataset. In the future, the presented method is extended to the design of
fusion-based DL models.
