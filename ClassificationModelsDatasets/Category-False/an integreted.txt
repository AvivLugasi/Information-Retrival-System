Background: Gardenia Fructus (GF), a traditional Chinese medicine of Gardenia Ellis in
Rubiaceae family, has the potential to clear heat and purge fire and has been widely used to
treat multiple infection-related diseases. However, the quality markers (Q-Markers} of GF
have not been revealed comprehensively.

Methods: In this experiment, the transgenic zebrafish lines, Tg (I-fabp:EGFP) and Tg (lyz:
EGFP), were used to evaluate two main kinds of traditional efficacies of GF,
hepatoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects. All the GF samples from different
production areas were tested their anti-liver injury and anti-inflammantory activities.
High-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry
method (HPLC-Q-TOF/MS) was employed for herbal metabonomic analysis of GF
samples. Gray correlation analysis (GCA) was utilized to screen out the components
closely associated with the activities. Finally, the zebrafish model was applied to verify the
bioactivity of the crucial components to determine the Q-Markers of GF.

Results: The zebrafish models were established by inducing with hydrogen peroxide or
copper sulfate and applied to quickly evaluate the hepatoprotective effect and
inflammation of GF samples. 27 potentially active components for liver protection and
21 potentially active components with anti-inflammatory properties were identified by
herbal metabolomic analysis based on HPLC-Q-TOF/MS. The GCA result showed that five
of the 27 components were highly correlated with liver protection, 15 of the 21
components were highly correlated with anti-inflammatory activity. Among them,
geniposide and crocin-1 were confirmed their bioactivities on zebrafish experiment to
be responsible for the protective effects of GF against liver injury, and genipin-1-B-D-
gentiobioside, quinic acid, gardenosice, p-glucuronic acid, L-malic acid, mannitol, rutin,
and chlorogenic acid were confirmed to be responsible for the anti-inflammatory effects.

Identification of Quality Markers

 

Finally, according to the screening principles of Q-Markers, genipin-1-6-D-gentiobioside,
geniposide, and garcenoside were preliminarily identified to be the Q-Markers of GF.

Conclusion: This study established an effective research strategy of “Omics

Discrimination-Grey Correlation-Biological

Verification,” which enabled the rapid

identification of key pharmacological components of GF. These markers have provided
a scientific basis for constructing a modern quality evaluation system for GF.

INTRODUCTION

Gardenia Fructus, the dried fruit of Gardenia jasminoides
Ellis in Rubiaceae family, has been recorded in the Shennong
Bencaojing treatize of the Han Dynasty (BC 202-AD 220) in
China. GF has the potential to clear Heat and purge Fire
(Chen et al., 2020). Furthermore, GF plays a significant
clinical role in the prevention and treatment of chronic
diseases such as liver and gallbladder diseases (Fan et al.,
2020) and metabolic diseases (L. Wang et al., 2020). Besides,
GF has been listed in medicine food homology in China, and
is also a common traditional medicinal food for the health
industry. However, the existing quality standard system of
traditional Chinese medicine is far from the requirements of
the actual market circulation and authentic
variety evaluation (X.Wu et al., 2018; C. Liu, Guo. DA
and L. Liu et al., 2018). Hence, studying the quality
evaluation chemical makers is crucial for ascertaining the
intrinsic quality of GF.

Quality markers (Q-Markers) is a new concept of scientific
quality evaluation of TCM proposed by the Chinese
academician Changxiao Liu in 2016. Q-markers is a
chemical substance inherent or formed during processing
and preparation of Chinese medicine materials and TCM
products (such as Chinese herbal pieces, Chinese herbs
decoction, extraction of TCM, Chinese patent medicine
preparation). It is closely related to the functional
properties of TCM, and is used as a marker substance
reflecting the safety and effectiveness of TCM for quality
control (C. X. Liu et al., 2016), and also forms the basis of
quality evaluation (Ren et al., 2020). In this research, we hope
to explore the Q-Markers of GF based on this theory, which
can lay the foundation for the establishment of scientific
quality control methods for GF.

For the quality evaluation of TCM, the use of Q-Markers is
an internationally accepted method to reflect the efficacy and
quality by assessing a limited number of chemical components.
However, it is not easy to confirm these key chemical
components (L. Xu et al., 2018). The routine research
methods are usually hard to track the unknown active
chemical components, or vast samples produced from
separation and separation process (X. Liu et al., 2021).
Therefore, more and more researchers are attempting to
explore and develop efficient identification methods for key
medicinal components. Metabolomics is an important branch

of systematic biology, which has high resolution and extremely
low detection limit. This approach can simultaneously detect
integral components in TCM (Jiang et al., 2016). However, due
to the large number of chromatographic peaks and small
sample size, it is not sufficient to perform most of the
general pharmacological tests. Therefore, we endeavored to
propose a more effective method to improve the accuracy of
chemical components extracted from the complex chemical
system of TCM.

At present, models of liver protection and inflammation based
on rodents (rats and mice) are commonly used for evaluating the
efficacy of TCM (Chiang et al., 2020; C. Y.; Liet al., 2016; W. K Li
et al., 2019). However, a large amount of experimental samples
volume is required for in vivo models, which is not easy to be
achieved for sample extracts of TCM. Moreover, it is difficult to
realize the evaluation of the monomer components in the later
stage. Zebrafish (Danio rerio), a tropical freshwater fish of the
Cyprinidae family, is a vertebrate model and is often used to study
human diseases (Lieschke and Currie, 2007). When compared
with mice and other commonly used in vivo animal models,
zebrafish has the advantages of small size, large number of
offspring, high transparency, easy breeding, low feeding cost,
and the ease of carrying out large-scale research (Lieschke and
Currie, 2007). The function of liver cells and histopathological
changes in zebrafish are very similar to humans. The molecular
mechanism of the development is also consistent with that of
mammals (Goessling and Sadler, 2015). Zebrafish is also widely
used to study the immune response to the acute phase of
infection, the interaction between pathogens and the host, and
the real-time migration of injured immune cells (Torraca and
Mostowy, 2018). Therefore, zebrafish was chosen as an
experimental model in this study. Although the limited
activities could hardly represent the efficacy of GF, we believe
that these two activities reflect main parts of the efficacy of GF.
What’s more, the zebrafish experiment supplied considerable
convenience to verify the activities of the selected monomer
components in vivo and validate the screening results (Y. P.
Shi et al., 2020).

Finally, we proposed a new integrated research strategy,
namely the “Omics Discrimination-Grey Correlation-Biological
Verification” by using herbal metabolomics, zebrafish model, and
other technologies. Exploration of the pharmacodynamic
markers closely related to the efficacy of GF provides an
important basis for constructing a quality evaluation system
with Q-Markers as the core.

Zebrafish Maintenance and Embryo

Collection

The transgenic line zebrafish, Tg (l-fabp:EGFP) and Tg (lyz:
EGFP), were provided by Shandong Province Engineering
Research Center of Zebrafish Models for Human Diseases
and Drug Screening (Biology Institute of Shandong
Academy of Sciences). The animals were cultivated in a
professional breeding system (Shanghai Haisheng Biotech
Co., Ltd.) and maintained under a 14h/10h light/dark cycle
at a constant temperature of 28 + 0.5°C. The zebrafish were fed
with fairy shrimp twice a day at 9:00 and 16:00 h. Adult male
and female zebrafish were placed in a ratio of 2:2 on both sides
of a partition board in a mating tank at night; the divider was
removed at 8:00 h the next day. The zebrafish was stimulated
by light to mate and lay eggs naturally. The embryos were
collected within 1 h of spawning and rinsed thrice with fresh
water. The clean embryos were transferred to Petri dishes
containing fish water (5mM NaCl, 0.17mM KCl, 0.4mM
CaCl, and 0.16mM MgSO,) and incubated at 28.5°C for
subsequent experiments (Avdesh. A et al., 2012). The
animal study was reviewed and approved by Ethics
Committee of Shandong First Medical University, Shandong
First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical
Sciences.

Preparation of Sample Solutions

All GF samples were ground to a powder form and sifted through
a 60-mesh screen. Then, the powder was extracted twice using
70% ethanol with a material-to-liquid ratio of 1:8 for 1h. The
supernatant of each sample was collected after centrifugation at
5,000 r/min for 10 min. The extracted GF samples were obtained
by rotary evaporation and drying at 60°C. Anesthetic (tricaine)
solution of 1gL~' concentration was prepared with distilled
water; 30% hydrogen peroxide was diluted 60 times with
ultrapure water to make a solution of 5 ml L' concentration;

Liver Protection and Anti-Inflammatory

Experiments in Zebrafish

Experimental Design

Zebrafish larvae that were 3 days post-fertilization (dpf) were
taken in a Petri dish. Larvae of normal and consistent
development were selected and placed in a _ 6-well
microplate, with 20 larvae per well. The animals was
divided into liver protection group and anti-inflammatory
group. All groups were pre-protected for 6h. The control
group (Con) was given only 0.5% DMSO. The indicated
concentration gradient of the drug group was set as shown
in the results section. In the liver protection experiment, all
groups (excluding the control group) were treated with H,0,
at a concentration of 25 uL L' for 2 days to induce liver injury
(Ma. J et al., 2020). The inflammation model of zebrafish was
established by using CuSO, at a concentration of 4 mg L” for
Lh (Gui et al., 2020). The positive group was treated with
ibuprofen at a concentration of 4mgL’.

Image Capture and Statistical Analysis

Ten zebrafish larvae were randomly selected from each group for
photographic observation. In the liver protection experiment, the
fluorescence of liver was observed using a fluorescence
microscopy. The images were collected and recorded for each
zebrafish larva. Fluorescence intensity of the liver (% of control)
was measured using Image Pro Plus 5.1 (Media Cybernetios Inc.,
Rockville, MD, United States). In the anti-inflammatory
experiment, abnormalities and the distribution of the
neutrophils were observed using a fluorescence microscope.
The neutrophils migrating to the lateral neuromast and above
were statistically analyzed by GraphPad Prism 6.01 (Graphpad
Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, United States). One-way analysis of
variance way was used to determine the statistical significance of
the differences among the groups, and the experimental data were
expressed as mean + standard error (SE). The difference was
considered to be significant when p was <0.05, and the difference
was considered to be extremely significant when p was <0.01 (“p
< 0.01 is vs. the control group; *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01 are vs.
model group).

Herbal Metabolomic Analysis
HPLC-Q-TOF/MS Analysis of GF

HPLC-Q-TOF/MS consists of a liquid chromatography system
(Agilent 1,200 Infinity Series) with a binary pump, degassing
device, automatic sampler, and ultraviolet detector as well as a
Q-TOF mass spectrometer (Agilent 6,520 series) to examine
the GF samples. An Eclipse XDB-C18 column (4.6 x 250 mm;
5 um; Agilent) was used as the chromatographic column. The
chromatographic conditions were as follows: the mobile phase
was composed of formic acid-water (0.1:100, v/v) (A) and
acetonitrile (B). The gradient elution program was 7-20% B for
0-10 min, 20-30% B for 10-13 min, 30% B for 13-17 min,
30%-7% B for 17-18 min, and 7% B for 18-25 min at a flow
rate of 1 ml/min. The sample injection volume was 20 uL. The
temperature of the column was set at 25°C. The detection wave
was set at 238nm. The MS conditions were as follows:

Electrospray ionization was in the negative ion mode, split
ratio was 2:1, scan range m/z was 100-1,100 Da, nebulizer
pressure was two psig, gas temperature was 350°C, drying gas
flow rate was 12 L/min, and capillary voltage was 3500 V. The
raw data of all GF samples were analyzed with Agilent
MassHunter Workstation and R software (R Development
Core Team, 2011).

Data Analysis

Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to describe the
natural distribution and aggregation states of the samples (Nie
et al., 2020). Orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant
analysis (OPLS-DA) was employed to distinguish the different
kinds of compounds from each other (Chung et al., 2019; B. M.;
Huang et al., 2018). S-plots provided visible OPLS-DA for model
explanation (Feng et al. 2018); A permutations test (PT)
evaluated the credibility of the OPLS-DA model (Bocca et al.
2021) using the software SIMCA-P14.1.

Gray Correlation Analysis

Gray correlation analysis (GCA) was used to examine the
correlation between two groups of variations (P. Li et al,
2020). In this study, the signal intensities of the different
components present in the 9GF samples (S1-S9) obtained
from different producing areas were measured. GCA was
applied to investigate the spectral-effect relationships between
signal intensity and biological activities related to liver injury and
inflammation in the zebrafish.

Specifically, Xo = {Xo (k)|k = 1,2,...,n} =
(xo (1), Xo (2),...,X9(n)) was set as the sequence of system
behavior characteristics. Furthermore, x = {xi (Qk =

1,2,...,n} = (xj (1), xi(2),...,xi(n)) was set as the sequence
of system associated factors, where k refers to the samples
collected from different origins, and i refers to the
compounds. Subsequently, the correlation coefficient (k)) and
the degree (ro) of GCA were formulated as follows:

min min |x (k) — x; (k)| + p.max max [Xp (k) — x; (k)
e(k)=— k ik

 

>

[x0 (k) — xi (| + p.-max max]xq (I) — x; (k)

12
To =— ) e(k),
ng

p is the resolution coefficient ranging from 0 to 1, usually 0.5.

The fluorescence intensity of the liver and the number of
neutrophils spreading to the lateral neuromast of the zebrafish in
the 9 GF samples were set as the sequence of system behavior
characteristics. The signal intensities of different component
variations of the 9GF samples were set as the sequence of
system associated factors. Owing to the different dimensions
of the two datasets, dimensionless processing was performed
on the original data to eliminate the adverse effects of unit
inconsistencies. Especially, for dimensionless processing, each
data point was divided by the average of the corresponding
sequence to calibrate and calculate the correlation coefficients
(M. Liu et al., 2020).

RESULT

Biological Activities of the GF Samples on
the Zebrafish

The zebrafish model of liver injury was produced using HQ, at a
concentration of 25 mgL' for 2 days. As shown in Figure 1A, the
fluorescence intensity decreased in the liver of zebrafish in the
H,0, model group when compared with those in the control
group. However, the fluorescence intensity in the zebrafish liver

was significantly improved in the GF groups of $1, $3, $6, S8, and
S9 (the dose received by each group was 500 mg L~') compared to
the H,O, model group (Figure 1B). The results signify that the
liver injury was relieved in the above GF groups. However, the
4 GF groups of $2, $4, 5, and $7 did not differ from the model
group in a statistically significant manner. The two groups with
the largest difference were S7 (Jiujiang, Jiangxi) and $8 (Fuding,
Fujian), with liver fluorescence intensities of 62.0 and 97.0%,
respectively.

near the lateral neuromast of the zebrafish tail were higher in
the CuSO, model group when compared with the control
group. The number of fluorescent spots near the lateral
neuromast of the zebrafish tail were significantly lowered
after treatment with ibuprofen. The above results suggest
that the inflammatory model of the zebrafish can be used to
study the anti-inflammatory efficacy of GF. Neutrophils
spreading close to the lateral neuromast of the zebrafish
tail were remarkably inhibited in the GF groups of $1,82, $3,
$4,86, S7, 88, and S9 (the dose received by each group was
500mgL') when compared with the CuSO, model
group (Figure 1D). The average number of fluorescent
spots near the lateral neuromast in the zebrafish tail in
the S4 (Panan, Zhejiang) and S6 (Jichun, Hubei) groups
were 27 and 17, respectively, and they exhibited the most
significant statistical difference among all the GF treatment
groups.

Comparison of Activity in GF Samples

Collected From Specific Locations

The protective effects of the GF samples S7 and S8 on liver
injury were compared and verified at different concentrations
(Figure 2B). The S4 and S6 GF samples were also evaluated
using the zebrafish inflammatory model to identify the
differences in their anti-inflammatory _ efficacies
(Figures 3A,B).

The results showed that $7 GF differed statistically from
the H,O, model group at a concentration of 750 mgL”’; $8
GF differed statistically significantly from the H,02 model
group at concentrations of 250, 500 and 750 mgL”'. There
were significant differences (p < 0.05) between S7 and S8
samples at concentrations of 250 and 500 mgL | (Figure 2B).
When compared with the H2O model group, the six batches
of GF from Fuding (S8, $13-S17) were statistically different,
which indicates their protective efficacy against liver injury.
The six batches of GF groups from Fuding and the four
batches of GF groups from Jiujiang (S7, $10-S12) had
significant differences (p < 0.01) (Figure 2C). These data
further demonstrate that differences in the location of GF
may be the main factor for the differences in the protective
effects against liver injury.

The results demonstrated that S4 GF differed statistically
significantly at concentrations of 500 and 750mgL™! from the
CuSO, model group; S6 GF was statistically significantly different
at concentrations of 250, 500, and 750 mgL'. There were
statistical differences between S4 and S6 samples at
concentrations of 500 and 750mgL”' (Figure 3B). When
compared with the CuSO, group, the five batches of GF from
Panan (S4, $18-S21) and the six batches of GF from Jichun (S6,
$22-826) significantly inhibited the inflammation. There were
statistically significant differences (p < 0.01) in samples obtained
from these two locations (Figure 3C). This finding suggests that
there are great variations in the biological activities of the GF
samples sourced from different regions regardless of the time of
collection.

Discovery of the Bioactive Compounds in

GF by Herbal Metabolomic Analysis

Ten batches of GF collected from Fuding and Jiujiang and 11
batches of GF collected from Panan and Jichun were analyzed
using HPLC-Q-TOF/MS to obtain the original MS data. After
being processed by MassHunter, the data were imported into R
software to extract information on ion fragments. Finally,
1,056 component ion fragments were acquired from GF of
Fuding and Jiujiang in the negative ion mode for further
multivariate statistical analysis. In the same way, 926
component ion fragments were gained from GF of Panan
and Jichun.

In the PCA scatter plot of 10 GF samples from Fuding and
Jiujiang in liver protection experiment (Figure 4A), the
confidence interval was 95%, significance level was 0.05, and
the first and second principal components were 53.1 and 15.3%,
respectively. The results signified that GF in the two groups were
clearly separated by the coordinate axis t [1]; PCA analysis was
performed on the 926 common ion fragments obtained from the
11 GF batches from Panan and Jichun in the above-mentioned
anti-inflammatory experiments. PCA plots (Figure 4E) were
constructed directly using the first principal component
(34.2%) and the second principal component 2 (23%), which
showed that the GF samples from Panan and Jichun were clearly
separated. The findings indicated that the chemical compositions
of the two were significantly different.

Intra-group differences cannot be ignored and random errors
cannot be eliminated by PCA, which is an unsupervized analysis
method. The technique ignores the changing regulations and
overall characteristics of the data, which is not conducive for
the discovery of inter-group differences and metabolite
differences (Hayashi et al., 2019). Therefore, this study used the
supervised OPLS-DA model (Han et al., 2018) to further analyze
the 1,056 and 926 common ion fragments obtained from 10
batches and 11 batches of GF, respectively. The OPLS-DA
model can maximize the differences between the two groups of
samples to determine the differences in the components between
the two groups (F. Wang et al., 2019). From Figures 4B,F, it can be
seen that the two groups of GF samples in the OPLS-DA model
were clearly distinguished from each other, and the values of R,Y
(cum) and Q, (cum) for the models were 0.996 and 0.951 and 0.889
and 0.929, respectively. These results indicate that the OPLA-DA
model has good applicability and predictability. The results of PT
were calculated to be [Ro= (0.0, 0.85), Qs = (0.0, —0.47)] and [R=
(0.0, 0.98), Q, = (0.0, —1.69)]. In addition, all the Q, values on the
left were less than the highest points on the right, and the
intersection point of the blue regression line and ordinate of the
Q, value was less than zero (X. Zhang et al., 2019) (Figures 4D,H).
This finding proves that the OPLS-DA model has good reliability.
VIP (variables important in the projection) value >2, p < 0.05, and
absolute value of the correlation coefficient |pcorr| > 0.58 were used
to screen and determine the potentially important fragment ions.
The results were represented using S-plots of the OPLA-DA model
in the statistical analysis (Figures 4C,G). The red dots represent the
filtered compounds. The protective effects of a total of 27
potentially important fragment ions against liver injury were

acquired by filtering, and 21 fragment ions of potential anti-
inflammatory activity components were identified (Table 2).

Results of GCA

GCA was used to analyze the spectral and effect relationships
among the 27 fragment ions obtained from previous
metabonomic analysis. The protective effects of GF sourced
from the nine producing areas against liver injury and the 21
fragment ions and anti-inflammatory efficacies of GF were also
examined. The gray relational degrees were calculated and sorted

order respectively to verify the potential active ingredient (degree
>0.7) (Table 3).

Identification of Active Components
Chemical information related to the GF components is provided
in Table 3. The mass numbers of four components related to
protection and 15 components related to anti-
inflammatory effect were analyzed qualitatively. After quality
measured by MS compared with the MS database of GF
chemical composition, possible compounds were identified.
Based on the retention time and m/z data from the total ion
chromatograms (TICs) of GF compounds, geniposide (1),
genipin-1-B-D-gentiobioside (2), and crocin-1 3) were
identified as the pharmacodynamic compounds offering liver
protection. In addition, component 4 was presumed to be 6"-O-
p-coumaroyl-genipin-gentiobioside, and component 5 was not
recognized (Figure 5A); The anti-inflammatory components
were finally identified as quinic acid (6), gardenoside (7),
b-glucuronic acid (9), L-malic acid (10), mannitol (11), Rutin
(12), p-glucaric acid (13), shanzhiside (14), chlorogenic acid
(15), and genipin-1-$-D-gentioside (2); Furthermore, due to the
large error of component 3, it could only be inferred as
feretoside. Components 16 and 17 were presumed to be 10-
O-acetylgeniposide and 6"-O-p-coumaroyl-genipin-
gentiobioside, and components 18 and 19 were not
confirmed (Figure 5B).

Confirmation of the Identified Bioactive

Compounds

The zebrafish model of liver injury was applied to verify whether
the above three identified components (geniposide, genipin-1-
B-D-gentiobioside and crocin-1) can be used as chemical markers
for the protective effects of GF on the liver. The results suggested
that the group administrated with genipin-1-B-D-gentioside did
not statistically differ from the H,O2 model group; hence, the
compound did not exhibit a protective effect. The groups
administrated with geniposide at concentrations of 400 mgL~!
and crocin-1 at concentrations of 50 and 100mgL7! were
statistically different from the H,0, model group, which
proved that the two components offered liver protection
(Figure 6A). The zebrafish model of inflammation was applied
to verify whether the 10 identified chemical components can be
used as anti-inflammatory markers. The results showed that
when compared with the model group, shanzhiside and
b-glucaric acid did not inhibit inflammation. Thus, the two
components cannot be used as anti-inflammatory markers. On
the other hand, quinic acid and 1-malic acid both differed
statistically significantly at concentrations of 25, 50, and
100 mgL”' from the CuSO, model group; Rutin was
statistically significantly different at concentrations of 125, 250,
and 500mgL'; There were significant differences (p < 0.01)
between p-glucuronic acid and the CuSO, model group at
concentrations of 50 and 100 mgL'; Gardenoside, mannitol,
chlorogenic acid and _— genipin-1-$-D-gentiobioside at
concentrations of 250 and 500 mgL~! inhibited inflammation
to varying degrees (Figure 6B).

DISCUSSION

According to ancient Chinese medical book’s record, the
traditional efficacy of GF can be classified into two main
categories: one is clearing Heat and the other is purging Fire.
According to modern pharmacology, the effect of “purging Fire”
is closely related to liver and gallbladder systems. At present, GF is
mainly used to treat two types of diseases: 1. dampness-heat
jaundice (J. Y. Li et al., 2017) such as epidemic or iteric hepatitis,
jaundice, fever, and short red urine caused by stagnation of
hepatochlic hygropyrexia; 2. eye redness, swelling, and pain
(Chen et al. 2020), caused by hepatobiliary fire attack and
other eye discomforts. These two kinds of diseases are related

to liver injury. Modern research has confirmed that decoction and
alcohol extract of GF have choleretic effect, promote bile
secretion, and reduce the bilirubin in the blood to promote its
rapid excretion (‘Tian et al., 2017). Seo (Seo et al., 2017) found that
genipin, the main component of GF, ameliorates galactosamine/
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced hepatocellular damage by
suppressing the signal transduction of necroptosis-mediated
inflammasome to exert hepatoprotective effects. Therefore, we
considered that the protective effect of GF against liver injury in
the zebrafish model can be applied as one of the evaluation
indexes of the efficacy of GF. On the other hand, the effectof
“clearing Heat” of GF is closely related to its anti-inflammatory
properties (Q. Wang et al., 2018). GF is mainly used to treat

of GF. Some studies have reported that geniposide has
significant hepatoprotective effects and gardenoside has anti-
inflammatory effects. Zhang et al. (T. Zhang et al., 2016). found
that geniposide can alter the abnormal liver metabolism caused
by ethanol exposure, thereby alleviating the disturbance of
amino acid metabolism and oxidative stress. Wang et al.
(J. Wang et al., 2016). stated that geniposide can protect
mice from liver injury caused by tripterygium glycosides as
it alleviates oxidative stress and inflammation and promotes
tissue repair and regeneration. Liang et al. (Liang et al., 2015)
indirectly clarified that gardenoside may inhibit the production
of inflammatory cytokines TNF-a, IL-16, and IL-6 while
exploring the effects of gardenoside on the steatosis of
HepG2 cells induced by free fatty acids. Interestingly, we
found that genipin-1-B-D-gentiobioside has a strong anti-
inflammatory effect, which has not been previously reported
in the literature. This effect warrants in-depth study to gather
more evidence for the heat-reducing effect of GF. The iridoid of
GF derived from Gardenia Ellis belonging to the Rubiaceae
family is considered to be a representative component and a
crucial chemical marker. Gardenoside, geniposide and genipin-
1-8-D-gentioside are the main components of iridoids. Among
them geniposide is the highest content. Quinic acid,
b-glucuronic acid, L-malic acid, mannitol and chlorogenic
acid belong to organic esters of GF, among which
chlorogenic acid is its representative component. Rutin is
the only flavonoid with anti-inflammatory activity in the
results of this study (W. Li et al., 2021; Xiao et al, 2017).
Therefore, based on the factors such as pharmacodynamic
correlation, herbal specificity, and measurability, we believe
that geniposide, genipin-1-$-D-gentiobioside, and gardenoside
have good representativeness and can reflect the intrinsic
quality of GF. Hence, they were identified to be the quality
markers of GF.

CONCLUSION

In summary, we have devised a new strategy to study the Q-Markers
of TCM with hepatoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects. In this
research, through the effective integration of herbal metabolomics,
zebrafish models, chemometrics, and other technologies, we have
quickly identified “markers” that can reflect the intrinsic quality of
TCM. We have also conducted research on the key pharmacodynamic
