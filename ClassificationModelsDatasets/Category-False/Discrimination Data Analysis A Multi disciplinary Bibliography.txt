Discrimination Data Analysis:
A Multi-disciplinary Bibliography

Andrea Romei and Salvatore Ruggieri

Abstract Discrimination data analysis has been investigated for the last fifty years in
a large body of social, legal, and economic studies. Recently, discrimination discov-
ery and prevention has become a blooming research topic in the knowledge discov-
ery community. This chapter provides a multi-disciplinary annotated bibliography
of the literature on discrimination data analysis, with the intended objective to pro-
vide a common basis to researchers from a multi-disciplinary perspective. We cover
legal, sociological, economic and computer science references.

6.1 Introduction

Discrimination refers to an unjustified distinction of treatment on the basis of any
physical or cultural trait, such as gender, race, religion or sexual orientation. The
problems of assessing the presence, the extent, the nature, and the trend of discrim-
ination are then of primary importance. In the last fifty years, such problems have
been investigated from social, legal, economic, and, recently, from a computer sci-
ence perspective. The issues of data collection and data analysis are persistent, uni-
fying themes along all the perspectives. We present an annotated multi-disciplinary
bibliography specifically focusing on “data-driven”, or empirical, or analytical, ap-
proaches. The ease of data storage and retention, the ever increasing computing
power, the development of intelligent data analysis and mining techniques make it
possible to apply “in-the-large” and to improve over classical statistical and econo-
metric techniques. The reference literature, however, is abundant and spread over
publications of many disciplines, as witnessed by our references: social sciences,
psychology, economics, finance, health research, housing and urban development,
statistics, biometrics, econometrics and data mining.

A complete bibliography would be an utopian goal. Our priority is to provide
the interested reader with references to survey, comparison, and overview papers
as well as with recent works on the subject. The chapter is structured as follows.
After introducing the relevant concepts and references from social and legal per-
spectives in Section 6.2, we concentrate on the vast research on economic models of
labour discrimination in Section 6.3. The approaches for collecting and analyzing
controlled data using (quasi-)experimental scientific methodologies are presented
in Section 6.4. Section 6.5 discusses discrimination in profiling and scoring, and,
finally, Section 6.6 reports on recent work on using data mining for discrimination
discovery and prevention.

6.2 Sociological and Legal Perspectives

From a sociological perspective, there are three main causes of discrimination: prej-
udice, rational racism, and unintentional discrimination. Prejudice leads to discrim-
ination when it concerns unfairly or unreasonably formed negative attitudes against
a protected! group. The vicious cycle of discrimination (Newman, 2008) starts from
a situation where prejudice causes a protected group to be socially disadvantaged.
This is interpreted as evidence that the group is inferior, which, in turn, creates re-
newed prejudice by increasing social distance, by reinforcing negative stereotypes,
and by legitimating negative feelings. Psychologists have investigated situations of
anxiety or concerns, called stereotype threats (Steele & Aronson, 1995), where per-
sons have the potential to confirm a negative stereotype of their social group, which
results in reduced performances of individuals. Rational racism is the result of ratio-
nal thinking. A form of rational racism is statistical discrimination, occurring when
the lack of knowledge about the skills of an individual is compensated by a prior
knowledge of the average performances of the group or category the individual be-
longs to. Another example of rational thinking occurs when an employer foresee a
negative impact on his business due to the prejudice of his customers against em-
ployers belonging to a protected group. Finally, unintentional discrimination occurs
not because of malevolent decisions, but due to the lack of awareness on the ef-
fects of a decision. This is the case of indifference, incorrect (execution of) proce-
dures or practices, lack of planning and analysis of the decision outcomes. Also, a
form of unconscious or implicit discrimination has been considered in the literature
(Bertrand et al., 2005; Greenwald & Krieger, 2006; Kang & Banaji, 2010). Together
with the concept of indirect discrimination (see later on), unintentional discrimina-
tion poses considerable problems for the data analyst to carefully take into account
the effects of decisions from the point of view of different protected groups. We
refer to (R. Brown, 2010; Newman, 2008) for a sociological overview of prejudice,
to (Whitley & Kite, 2009) for a psychological discussion”, to (Quillian, 2006) for a

review of racial prejudice, and finally, to (Harford, 2008) for a discussion of rational
racism. (Yamagishi et al., 1999) review social theories of in-group favoritism.

In the legal context, provisions on equality or non-discrimination? are firmly em-
bedded within the key human rights treaties of the United Nations Legislation (Uni-
ted Nations Legislation, 2011). Anti-discrimination laws, however, have evolved
differently in common law countries compared to civil law ones. The United States
(US) Federal Legislation (U.S. Federal Legislation, 2011), the U.K. Legislation
(U.K. Legislation, 2011) and the Australian Legislation (Australian Legislation,
2011) follow the common law characteristic of “the absence of systematisation,
or a desire thereof” (Schiek et al., 2007, Introductory Chapter), with the result that
laws have been developed ground-by-ground and with reference to specific con-
texts, possibly with different ruling from one case to another. The European Union
(EU) Legislation (European Union Legislation, 2011) and the EU Member States
follow a principled approach, resulting in laws covering a (long) list of grounds of
discrimination. For a deeper legal discussion and comparison of national and inter-
national laws, we refer the reader to books on international group rights (N. Lerner,
2003; Schiek et al., 2007), on EU laws (Ellis, 2005; E.U. Agency for Fundamental
Rights, 2011), and on US laws (Bamforth et al., 2008). Several independent author-
ities (equality enforcement bodies, regulation boards, consumer advisory councils,
commissions) provide advice, monitor, and report on discrimination compliances.
For instance, the EU Commission* publishes an annual report on the progress in
implementing the Equal Treatment Directives by the Member States (Chopin & Do,
2010); and in the US Attorney General reports to the Congress about the annual re-
ferrals to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. A general legal principle is to consider
group under-representation in obtaining a benefit as a quantitative measure of (in-
direct) discrimination against a protected group. Data collection and statistical data
analysis are recognized as fundamental both in the common law and in the civil
law countries (R. M. Blank et al., 2004; Makkonen, 2006, 2007). It is commonly
agreed, however, that the statistical conclusions establish a prima facie evidence of
discrimination, which may be rebutted by the respondent using further arguments
(e.g., a genuine occupational requirement or an objective justification). We refer to
(Wingate & Thornton, 2000; Finkelstein & Levin, 2001) for a review of statistical
methods in discrimination litigations. The book edited by (Kaye & Aickin, 1992)
contains a collection of papers on the subject. A continuously updated book on sta-
tistical methods and case laws is maintained by (Paetzold et al., 1994). Finally, the
interdisciplinary economic-legal survey by (Donohue, 2007) provides an overview
of the connections between economic models and empirical findings from the one
side, and the US anti-discrimination laws on the other side. A related legal concept
that is worth mentioning is the one of affirmative actions, sometimes called posi-
tive actions, which are a range of policies to overcome and to compensate for past
and present discrimination by providing opportunities to those traditionally denied

recalls, in addition, a set of positive obligations to reach the ideal of equal treatment (Bell, 2002).

for (ENAR, 2008; Holzer & Neumark, 2004; Sowell, 2005). They range from the
mere encouragement of under-represented groups to preferential treatment or quo-
tas in favor of those groups (see e.g., Holzer & Neumark, 2006; R. Lerner & Nagai,
2000).

Since discrimination can arise only through the application of different rules or
practices to comparable situations or of the same rule or practice to different sit-
uations, a relevant legal distinction is between direct and indirect discrimination.
When such rules or practices explicitly treat one person less favourably on a for-
bidden ground than another is, has been or would be treated in a comparable sit-
uation, we have direct discrimination, sometimes called systematic discrimination
or disparate treatment. When an apparently neutral provision, criterion or practice
results in an unfair treatment of a protected group, we have indirect discrimination,
sometimes called adverse impact (Tobler, 2008). While direct discrimination is in-
tentional and “directed” towards individuals, typically on the basis of their visible
traits, such as ethnic origin, race, sex and age, indirect discrimination is concerned
with avoiding the circumvention of the prohibition to discriminate, and to enforce
such a prohibition substantively, even in the case of unintentionality.

6.3 Labour Economic Perspective

In the labor market, different treatments among groups of workers can be measured
in terms of their wages (wage differentials), in the degree of participation in the
labor force (employment differentials), or in the degree of segregation in specific oc-
cupations or industries (segregation differentials). Public surveys routinely collect
data on demographic characteristics and attitudes of residents (e.g., in the US, the
General Social Survey - GSS), on the distribution of labor forces in the labor market
(e.g., Current Population Survey - GPS), and so on. Empirical research techniques
have applied statistical inference to collected data either with the purpose of test-
ing the consequences predicted by a theoretical economic model, or to assess the
contribution of different types of discrimination to the overall different treatments
in the labor market. The main data analysis techniques adopted include statistical
tests on rates and proportions (Agresti, 2002; Fleiss et al., 2003; Sheskin, 2004),
(generalized) linear regression models (Dobson & Barnett, 2008; Hardin & Hilbe,
2007; McCullagh & Nelder, 1989), and econometric models (Greene, 2008).

Two major theoretical models of discrimination have been considered in the eco-
nomic literature. Taste-based discrimination, originally proposed by (Becker, 1971),
has no rational or economic basis, but only a prejudiced personal taste against pro-
tected groups. Wage differentials are due to an additional psychological cost for
employing minority workers. Differently, statistical discrimination, originated by
(Arrow, 1971) and (Phelps, 1972) and systematized by (Aigner & Cain, 1977), starts
from the assumption that employers cannot perfectly assess worker productivity at
the time of hiring. This market imperfection gives them an incentive to use easily
observable characteristics, such as sex and race, as proxies for the expected produc-
6 Discrimination Data Analysis: A Multi-disciplinary Bibliography 5

tivity, estimated by their prior knowledge on the average productivity of the group
the worker belongs to. Wages are then set on the basis of the expected productiv-
ity of the group, not on the basis of the person’s productivity. We refer the reader to
(Altonji & Blank, 1999) for a comprehensive mathematical introduction to both the-
ories of economic discrimination, as well as for past empirical approaches to show
direct evidence. More recent or comprehensive reviews of theories and empirics in
labor market are available in (Cain, 1987; Charles & Guryan, 2011; Kunze, 2008;
Lang & Lehmann, 2011). (Weichselbaumer & Winter-Ebmer, 2005) conduct a meta
regression analysis of the works on gender wage differentials, where each point of
data is not an individual but a research study. (Neal & Johnson, 1996) observed that,
after controlling for the ability of a worker, the racial wage gap greatly reduces. In
such a study, ability was measured through the controversial Armed Forces Qualify-
ing Test (AFQT) score, a test of cognitive skills taken by male adolescents and avail-
able from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. In the following, we briefly
review the most recent lines of research and extensions of the two economic models.

Approaches on taste-based discrimination. The additional cost of minority work-
ers in presence of taste-based discrimination leads to an equilibrium wage differen-
tial and to segregation of minority workers in less discriminating firms or for specific
occupations. Lower earning for discriminatory firms implies that discrimination oc-
curs mainly in low competitive markets. This is known as the static implication of
the Becker’s model?. Influential papers are (Charles & Guryan, 2008), which com-
bine GSS data (to measure racial prejudice) with CPS data (to measure differences
in wages), and (Hellerstein et al., 2002), which relate firm profitability to the pro-
portion of female workers both in low competition and high competition markets.
Recent approaches using survey data include (Sano, 2009; Tsao & Pearlman, 2010;
Zhang & Dong, 2008). On the basis of the identity of the discriminator, Becker’s
model distinguishes employer discrimination (taste in hiring), customer discrimina-
tion (taste in buying), and co-employee discrimination (taste in co-operating). Re-
cent analyses of consumer discrimination have been conducted on data from restau-
rants (Parrett, 2011; Myers, 2007), contact jobs (Combes et al., 2011), retail stores
(Leonard et al., 2010), Major League Baseball (Coyne et al., 2010) and taxicab
drivers (Ayres et al., 2005). Evidence of correlation between the predominant race
of customers and the race of the marginal hired worker has been shown in (Holzer
& Thlanfeldt, 1998).

The working context of professional sports, such as baseball, basketball, foot-
ball, and soccer, offers an unusually good opportunity of studying discrimination.
The problem of estimating the productivity of workers is here substantially solved
by extensive, publicly available (from online sport almanacs), measures of the per-

> The dynamic implication of the Becker’s model predicts that non-discriminating employers earn
higher profits by hiring members of the protected group, and, in the long run and in a competitive
market, discriminatory firms will be driven out of the market. The dynamic implication has been
investigated in the context of banking deregulation (Black & Strahan, 2001; Levine et al., 2008),
globalization (Black & Brainerd, 2004; Neumayer & de Soysa, 2007; Oostendorp, 2009) and in
the adoption of equality laws worldwide (Weichselbaumer & Winter-Ebmer, 2007).

formances of players and coaches. Research has covered discrimination in hiring,
in retaining (along seasons), in segregating (to specific game roles), and in salary
of players, as well as customer discrimination. The last topic is also known as fan
discrimination, typically measured using TV audience (Aldrich et al., 2005), game
attendance (Foley & Smith, 2007; Hersch, 2009; Wilson & Ying, 2003), the trad-
ing value of sport cards (Broyles & Keen, 2010; Primm et al., 2011), the votes for
best player awards (Jewell et al., 2002). As far as salary discrimination in profes-
sional sports is concerned with, there is an extensive literature on the subject. We
mention only a few recent papers (Berri & Simmons, 2009; Holmes, 2011; Frick
& Deutscher, 2009; Goddard & Wilson, 2009; Palmer & King, 2006; Yang & Lin,
2010), and refer the reader to the surveys (Kahn, 1991b, 2000, 2009).

Extensions of taste-based discrimination, called search models (Altonji & Blank,
1999; Lang & Lehmann, 2011), take into account the costs for workers of searching
jobs by interacting with prejudiced and non-prejudiced firms, and, for consumers,
the costs of searching sellers of their same racial group (Flabbi, 2010; Kuhn & Shen,
2009; Sulis, 2007; Usui, 2009). Finally, a line of studies, initiated by (Hamermesh &
Biddle, 1994), investigates the “beauty premium” in labor market. As a recent work,
we mention (Cipriani & Zago, 2011), who study favoritism to attractive students in
taking exams at University. The effectiveness of blind decisions in reducing gender
discrimination has been evaluated for orchestra auctions in (Goldin & Rouse, 2000).

Approaches on statistical discrimination. Some extensions of the statistical dis-
crimination model deal with what happens as the employer’s information on work-
ers’ productivity changes, e.g., at the selection time or over the course of the job.
These dynamic extensions, contrasted to a static model, are known as employer
learning models. (Farber & Gibbons, 1996) propose a dynamic model of learning
about worker ability in a competitive labor market. Altonji and Pierret provide a
first important strand literature on learning models (Altonji & Pierret, 2001). We
complement the studies surveyed in the recent paper (Lang & Lehmann, 2011) by
mentioning: (Cheung, 2010), in testing whether parental education is used as a proxy
for the ability of workers; and (Wang, 2010), in considering height as an easily ob-
servable characteristic.

Also, the differential observability or learnability of worker’s productivity among
groups has been taken into account by screening discrimination models, originally
introduced in (Lang, 1986). Such differences are due, e.g., to miscommunication
problems or weak interactions among groups. As an example, (Grogger, 2011) an-
alyzes audio data from telephone interviews to understand the role that speech may
play in explaining racial wage differences, and (Pinkston, 2006) shows that the level
of education has a large impact on wages. Similar work emerges from the health lit-
erature, when testing whether miscommunication problems influence a diagnosis
(Balsa et al., 2005; Mcguire et al., 2008) or whether “expert” patients obtain a more
favorable treatment (Grytten et al., 2011). Another strand of statistical discrimina-
tion models studies how negative rational stereotypes of employers differentiates
firms’ hirings and wages, and workers’ investments, e.g., in education. (Lang &
Lehmann, 2011) call this class as rational stereotyping models. Finally, we refer to
6 Discrimination Data Analysis: A Multi-disciplinary Bibliography 7

the survey (Fang & Moro, 2010) for a theoretical discussion of models of statistical
discrimination and affirmative actions.

6.4 (Quasi-)Experimental Perspective

A recurring problem in discrimination analysis is the collection of controlled data,
as opposed to observational data, for which the results of analytical and statistical
techniques can be interpreted without any concern for external or confounding fac-
tors. This has been tackled through quasi-experimental and experimental methods,
that we review in the next two subsections.

6.4.1 Auditing

Auditing, also known as field experiments, follows a quasi-experimental approach
to investigate for the presence of discrimination by controlling the factors that may
influence decision outcomes. The basic idea consists of using pairs of testers (also
called auditors), who have been matched to be similar on all characteristics that
may influence the outcome except race, gender, or other grounds of possible dis-
crimination. The tester pairs are then sent into one or more situations in which
discrimination is suspected, e.g., to rent an apartment or to apply for a job, and
the decision outcome is recorded. The difference in the outcomes among the paired
groups provides then a measure of discrimination. A summary of recent audit stud-
ies in employment discrimination is due to (Pager, 2007). (Riach & Rich, 2002)
review and compare the statistical significance of field experiments on racial, sex,
and disability discrimination in employment, and on discrimination on housing sale
and rental. Criticism of the conclusions drawn from audit methods is discussed in
(Heckman & Siegelman, 1993) and (Heckman, 1998), while (Riach & Rich, 2004)
comment on ethical implications of such methods. (Quillian, 2006) discusses how
the measurement of discrimination through audit methods should incorporate recent
advancement in psychological theories of prejudice.

We categorize three different approaches in detecting discrimination by auditing.

Situation testing occurs when the testers come in contact with the decision maker.
This is the case, for instance, of job interviews involving human testers, who are se-
lected and trained in advance to act similar each other (Bendick et al., 2010; Moreno
et al., 2004; Pager & Quillian, 2005; Pager et al., 2009; Turner & Ross, 2005; Turner
et al., 2002). A strong point in favor of situation testing is that testers can record the
cause of discrimination, such as prejudice or stereotypes, hence allowing for a causal
analysis of the discrimination cases. A limitation of situation testing is that the phase
of data collection is expensive. In addition, situation testing cannot be applied at all
in some contexts, e.g., in wage rising discrimination, or in disparate application of
contractual terms, e.g., in house lending (Roscigno et al., 2009). (Bendick, 2007)
8 A. Romei and S. Ruggieri

reviews more than 30 situation testing studies in employment discrimination in the
US, while (Rorive, 2009) covers the EU Member States context.

In correspondence testing, the data scarcity problem is mitigated by designing
paired ad-hoc fake resumes or application forms to be sent to advertised vacancies,
and by assigning to each of them a typical white American name or an African-
American sounding name (Arai et al., 2008; Banerjee et al., 2009; Bertrand &
Mullainathan, 2004; Carlsson & Rooth, 2007; Kaas & Manger, 2010; Neumark,
2010). Other grounds of discrimination have been covered with a correspondence
testing approach in job applications, including sex (Riach & Rich, 2006; Booth &
Leigh, 2010), obesity (Rooth, 2009), sexual orientation (Drydakis, 2009), ethnicity
(McGinnity et al., 2009).

Larger opportunities for data collection are offered by emerging Internet job ad-
vertisement services, known as e-recruiting (Booth et al., 2010; Edin & Lagerstrgm,
2006). The synthetic generation of resumes is tackled in (Lahey & Beasley, 2009)
by a parametric tool that mitigates the bias that is present in manually generated
CVs. The legal implications of possible discrimination in e-recruiting, as compared
to classical means of recruiting, are discussed in (Hogler et al., 1998). In addition,
contexts other than employment can be covered, such as discrimination in product
advertising in internet marketing (Doleac & Stein, 2010; Nunley et al., 2010), and in
on-line rental housing (Ahmed & Hammarstedt, 2008; Bosch et al., 2010; Friedman
et al., 2010; Hanson & Hawley, 2011; Taylor, 2010).

6.4.2 Controlled Experiments

Field experiments construct control groups by matching similar persons and then
observing the outcome of a quasi-experiment in a natural environment, e.g., in a
job selection procedure. Empirical data from field experiments reflect a variety of
environmental factors: disentangling these factors may be difficult if not impossible.
Controlled experiments are conducted in an artificial environment, such as a labora-
tory, under tightly controlled conditions, including selection of treatment and control
groups and strict rules on their behavior and actions. On the one hand, the impact
of a specific factor can be evaluated by systematically varying it. On the other hand,
confounding variables and other extraneous stimuli can be minimized. Controlled
experiments are very useful to test the predictions of some theoretical model or to
pre-test the impact of some ruling or laws before their application. Also, controlled
experiments are repeatable, by definition, and less expensive than field experiments.
The main criticism against controlled experiments is that they suffer of lack of re-
alism, also called external validity. (Harrison & List, 2004) propose a taxonomy
of experiments. We refer to (Charness & Kuhn, 2011; Levitt & List, 2007) and
(R. M. Blank et al., 2004, Chapter 6) for an in-deep discussion on methodological
strengths and on the limits of generalizing results obtained from experiments.

We distinguish here two classes of controlled experiments, namely laboratory
experiments and natural experiments.
6 Discrimination Data Analysis: A Multi-disciplinary Bibliography 9

(Levitt & List, 2007) review five classes of games used in the economic literature
to measure social preferences through laboratory experiments, including fairness,
trust, and conditional reciprocity. The reviewed games include dictator and ultima-
tum games, public goods games, trust and gift exchange games. As an example,
(Fershtman & Gneezy, 2001) adopt trust games, dictator and ultimatum games to
test for ethnic discrimination. The trust game assumes a “player A”, who is given a
fixed amount of money and asked to transfer a certain amount to “player B”. The
transferred amount is triplicated. Then, “player B” can choose to transfer any part of
the received amount back to “player A”. Players A and B are randomly paired from
students of different ethnicity. The lower average amount of money transferred to
players of a specific ethnicity, compared to others ethnicities, is considered evi-
dence of discrimination . Recent controlled experiments can be found in the context
of sports card market (J. List, 2004), employment (Feltovich & Papageorgiou, 2004;
Falk et al., 2008) and wages differentials (Gtith et al., 2010; Dickinson & Oaxaca,
2009), beauty and speech differences (Andreoni & Petrie, 2008; Rédin & Ozcan,
2011). Moreover, gender (Slonim & Guillen, 2010), racial (Castillo & Petrie, 2010)
and district-based (Falk & Zehnder, 2007) differences have been studied in the con-
text of in-group discrimination and favoritism.

Natural experiments occur in real life (yet, controlled) situations. The experi-
menter only observes the behavior of participants, who typically are not aware of
the experiment. Television game shows are a typical example, where discriminatory
choices of participants can be studied in a controlled environment. Discrimination
analysis has been reported in (Antonovics et al., 2005, 2009; Bagues & Villadoniga,
2008; Levitt, 2004), with data gathered from the Weakest Link game show, in (Lee,
2009) with data from American Idol TV contest show, and in (J. A. List, 2006) with
data from Friend or Foe?. Sources of favoritism to attractive people by analysing
data from a TV game show based on the prisoner’s dilemma are studied in (Belot
et al., 2008). In addition to the criticism of external validity, natural experiments
have also the problem that not all factors are under control, e.g., the selection of
participants to a TV game show.

6.5 Profiling Perspective

Profiles consists of patterns, rules, or any other form of knowledge that can be used
to screen people when searching for those with a certain behavior. They occur in
many context, from criminal investigation to marketing, from genetic screening to
web site personalization, from fraud prevention to location-based services. Profiling
is the process of extracting profiles, either by manually eliciting them from domain
experts or by automatically inferring them from historical data using increasingly
sophisticated machine learning and data mining techniques. The process of profiling
also concerns the application of profiles to screen individuals, e.g., as in the case of
credit risk scoring and in the identification of security risks — which are covered in
10 A. Romei and S. Ruggieri

the next two subsections. We refer to (Hildebrandt & Gutwirth, 2008) for a cross-
disciplinary perspective of automated profiling.

6.5.1 Racial Profiling

Profiling is an illegal practice as soon as its application results in direct or indirect
discrimination against protected groups. In this section, we concentrate on racial
profiling, defined as “the practice of subjecting citizens to increased surveillance or
scrutiny based on racial or ethnic factors rather than reasonable suspicion” (J. Chan,
2011). Among several possible contexts of racial profiling, vehicle stops have at-
tracted the vast majority of studies®. Numerous data collection efforts have been
initiated by law enforcement agencies, often as a result of litigation or of legislation,
for the purpose of understanding the vehicle stop practices of its officers. Attributes
collected concern the stop (time, date, location, reason, duration), driver (race, gen-
der, age), vehicle (make, model), officer (age, gender, race, education, experience),
and the outcome of the stop (e.g., warning, citation, arrest, search, seizure of contra-
band). The objective of data analysis is to identify racial patterns of disparity. One
of the early surveys on racial profiling is due to (Engel et al., 2002). More recent
papers include (Farrell & McDevitt, 2010; Tillyer et al., 2010), reviewing vehicle
stops approaches. The adequacy of statistical analysis of racial profiling in address-
ing legal issues is also discussed in (Tillyer et al., 2008). For a legal comparison of
US and EU laws, see (Baker & Phillipson, 2011).

(Tillyer et al., 2010) categorize existing approaches depending on whether they
deal with the initial decision or with the outcome of a stop.

In initial stop studies, the actual rate of stops by drivers’ race is compared with
benchmark data providing the expected rate of stops assuming no police bias. The
outermost difficulty of the approach consists of identifying accurate benchmarks of
the expected driver population at risk of being stopped. (Engel & Calnon, 2004),
and (R. M. Blank et al., 2004, Chapter 9) outline strengths and limitations of six
primary data sources and their use in the design of benchmark data: census data,
observations of roadway usage, official accident data, assessments of traffic violat-
ing behaviour, citizen surveys, and internal departmental comparisons. Alternative
means for collecting benchmark data are proposed in (Alpert et al., 2004; Jobard &
Lévy, 2011; Quintanar, 2009; Ridgeway & MacDonald, 2009; Gelman et al., 2007).

Post-stop outcome studies focus on the identification of racial disparities in a spe-
cific outcome of the stop by taking as reference population the whole set of stops.
An example of post-stop outcome analysis consists of checking whether the search
for drugs among stopped vehicles is biased against the driver’s race. In this respect,
starting from the influential paper proposed in (Knowles et al., 2001), several ex-
tensions and critiques have been presented (Antonovics & Knight, 2009; Anwar

6.5.2 Credit Markets

Discrimination in the lending process may occur at several steps, from advertis-
ing, to pre-application enquires, to loan approval/denial, up to loan administration
(Turner & Skidmore, 1999). Among the various credit markets, mortgage lending
has received most of the interest. In all cases, however, the main challenge is in the
difficulty of estimating the risk of granting a loan to an applicant on the basis of her
financial capacity and her personal characteristics.

In the US, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) requires lenders to
gather and to make available census data about their mortgage applications. Since
1990, the HMDA has been integrated with information on discrimination grounds of
applicants. One of the first relevant contribution is due to researchers at the Federal
Reserve Bank of Boston in the research work known as Boston Fed Study (Munnell
et al., 1996). They supplemented the original census HMDA data for Boston with
additional information on the credit history of more than 3,000 individual applicants,
including data from more than one hundred financial institutes. Several criticisms
of the Boston Fed study appeared in the literature (Ross & Yinger, 2002, Chapter
5), (Longhofer & Peters, 1999), (Turner & Skidmore, 1999, Chapter 3). Among the
problems highlighted, we mention data errors, misclassification problems, endoge-
nous explanatory variables and the omitted variables bias (e.g., loan amount and
indicator of cosigner were missing). A theoretical and empirical survey on racial
disparities in mortgage lending markets in the context of the fair housing legisla-
tion is provided in (LaCour-Little, 1999). (G. Dymski, 2006) describes the state-
of-the-art on discrimination in housing and credit markets both from a legal and an
economic perspective. A recent review has been proposed in (Yezer, 2010), which
devises three approaches of testing disparities in loan approval decisions: mortgage
rejection, pricing and defaults.

In mortgage rejection, the disproportionate rate of rejected decisions between
racial groups of applicants is considered prima facie evidence of discrimination.
Empirical studies (Clarke et al., 2009; Dietrich, 2009; Dietrich & Johannsson, 2005;
Goenner, 2010; Sanandaji, 2009) include the analysis of HMDA data at bank level
(i.e., a model for each bank under analysis) or at a market level (i.e., a single model
aggregating variables for several banks). An experimental comparison of the two
approaches is reported in (Blackburn & Vermilyea, 2006). Other sources of data
range from micro-lending data (Agier & Szafarz, 2010) to on-line data derived from
a peer-to-peer lending site (Pope & Sydnor, 2011).

Mortgage pricing concentrates on the dataset of approved loans, by considering
whether a minority group is systematically charged with the highest interest rates.
12 A. Romei and S. Ruggieri

Recent mortgage pricing studies consider gender and racial discrimination in con-
sumer credit (Edelberg, 2007), such as credit cards and education loans, in private
firm credit (Albareto & Mistrulli, 2011; Blanchard et al., 2008; Blanchflower et
al., 2003; Cavalluzzo et al., 2002; Muravyev et al., 2009), in subprime home loans
(Bocian et al., 2008; Reid & Laderman, 2009), in household credit (Weller, 2008).
Using survey data, (P. Cheng et al., 2009) found that women pay higher rates be-
cause they do not search for best-rate loans as much as men do.

Mortgage default studies adopt the percentage of mortgage defaults as a mea-
sure of discrimination. Intuitively, if different default rates are observed for equally
creditworthy groups that differ in some discrimination ground, this is considered
prima facie evidence of discrimination. Recent contributions on the subject include
(C. L. Brown & Simpson, 2010; S. Chan et al., 2010; Yezer, 2010). A discussion
of the limitations of data on mortgage defaults, including unobserved variables and
sample-selection bias, can be found in (Turner & Skidmore, 1999, Chapter 5).

Discrimination in mortgage rejection and pricing has often occurred indirectly,
through the practice of redlining (Hillier, 2003),(Turner & Skidmore, 1999, Chapter
4), which consists of denying credit or of applying higher interest rates to people
living in some specific neighborhood. The use of geographic attributes may hide
(intentionally or not) the fact that such a neighborhood is populated mainly by peo-
ple of a specific race or minority. US cities, in particular, show a very high racial
divide. The percentage of individuals of a protected group in a neighborhood is
often used as a measure of the level of segregation (James & Tauber, 1985; Rear-
don & Firebaugh, 2002). Empirical works combine HMDA data with census data
(Silverman, 2005; E. Blank et al., 2005; Blackburn & Vermilyea, 2007; Ding et
al., 2008; Ezeala-Harrison et al., 2008; Wyly et al., 2008; Rugh & Massey, 2010;
Squires et al., 2009; Vicki et al., 2009; G. A. Dymski et al., 2011) to test for such a
form of indirect discrimination. As an alternative, (Campbell et al., 2008) use pro-
prietary data on unsecured debt. Other studies on redlining use house market data
(Aalbers, 2007; Ezeala-Harrison et al., 2008), consumer credit card data (Brevoort,
2011; Cohen-Cole, 2009), and insurance data (Ong & Stoll, 2007; Ross & Tootell,
2004).

Finally, in the related context of consumer markets, price discrimination is the
practice of a retailer, wholesaler, or manufacturer of selling the same product, with
the same marginal cost, at different prices based on buyers’ willingness to pay
(Armstrong, 2006). Differential pricing discriminating racial minorities has been
observed in the car sales market (Ayres, 1995; Ayres & Siegelman, 1995; Goldberg,
1996).

6.6 Knowledge Discovery Perspective

The issue of discrimination analysis has been considered from a knowledge discov-
ery, also known as data mining, perspective along two directions: discrimination
discovery and prevention.
6 Discrimination Data Analysis: A Multi-disciplinary Bibliography 13

Discrimination discovery from data consists in the actual discovery of discrim-
inatory situations and practices hidden in a large amount of historical decision
records. The aim is to unveil contexts of possible discrimination on the basis of
legally-grounded measures of the degree of discrimination suffered by protected-
by-law groups in such contexts. The legal principle of under-representation has in-
spired existing approaches for discrimination discovery based on pattern mining.
Starting from a dataset of historical decision records, (Pedreschi et al., 2008; Rug-
gieri et al., 2010a) propose to extract classification rules such as RACE=BLACK,
PURPOSE=NEW_CAR —> CREDIT=NO, called potentially discriminatory (PD) rules,
to unveil contexts (here, people asking for a loan to buy a new car) where the pro-
tected group (here, black people) suffered from under-representation with respect
to the decision (here, credit denial). The approach has been implemented on top
of an Oracle database by relying on tools for frequent itemset mining (Ruggieri et
al., 2010b), and extended in (Pedreschi et al., 2009; Ruggieri et al., 2010c; Luong,
2011). The main limitation of the approach is that there is no control of the char-
acteristics (e.g., capacity to repay the loan) of the protected group, versus, or as
opposed to others in this context.

This results in an overly large number of PD rules that need to be further
screened. (Luong et al., 2011) exploit the idea of situation testing. For each member
of the protected group with a negative decision outcome, testers with similar char-
acteristics are searched for in a dataset of historical decision records. If one can ob-
serve significantly different decision outcomes between the testers of the protected
group and the testers of the unprotected group, one can ascribe the negative decision
to a bias against the protected group, thus labeling the individual as discriminated.
The approaches so far described assume that the dataset under analysis contains
items to denote protected groups. This may be not the case when such items are not
available, or not even collectable at micro-data level, e.g., as in the case of the loan
applicant’s race. (Ruggieri et al., 2010a, 2010c) adopt a form of rule inference to
cope with the indirect discovery of (either direct or indirect) discrimination.

Discrimination prevention in data mining and machine learning consists of ex-
tracting models (typically, classifiers) that trade off accuracy for non-discrimination.
In fact, mining from historical data may mean to discover traditional prejudices that
are endemic in reality (i.e., taste-based discrimination), or to discover patterns of
lower performances, skills or capacities of protected-by-law groups (ie., statistical
discrimination). Mining algorithms may then assign to such discriminatory prac-
tices the status of general rules, which are subsequently used for automatic decision
making in socially sensitive tasks (see e.g., (N. Cheng et al., 2011; Chien & Chen,
2008; Yap et al., 2011)).

Discrimination prevention has been recognized as an issue in the tutorial (Clifton,
2003, Slide 19), where the danger of building classifiers capable of redlining dis-
crimination in home loans has been put forward. In predictive statistics, the same
issue has been raised by (Pope & Sydnor, 2007). The naive approach of deleting
attributes that denote protected groups from the original dataset does not prevent a
classifier to indirectly learn discriminatory decisions, since other attributes strongly
correlated with them could be used as a proxy by the model extraction algorithm.
14 A. Romei and S. Ruggieri

This issue has been observed in (Pope & Sydnor, 2007; Ruggieri et al., 2010a).
We categorize three non mutually-exclusive strategies toward discrimination pre-
vention: (i) a controlled distortion of the training set (a pre-processing approach)
(Kamiran & Calders, 2009; Zliobaite et al., 2011; Luong et al., 2011; Hajian et al.,
2011); Gi) a modification of the classification learning algorithm (an in-processing
approach), by integrating anti-discrimination criteria within it (Calders & Verwer,
2010; Kamiran et al., 2010; Kamishima et al., 2011); (iii) a post-processing of
the classification model, once it has been extracted, to correct its decision criteria
(Pedreschi et al., 2009; Calders & Verwer, 2010).

6.7 Conclusions

The collection and analysis of observational and experimental data is the main
tool for assessing the presence, the extent, the nature, and the trend of discrimi-
nation phenomena. In this chapter, we provided an annotated bibliography of the
main references and of recent works on discrimination data analysis from a multi-
disciplinary perspective. Our intended objective was to provide a guidance through
the abundant literature to researchers and anti-discrimination analysts that are faced
with data analysis problems. Substantively, the reader is referred to works on so-
ciological causes, legal norms, economic models, empirical studies, data collection
approaches, profiling methods, discrimination discovery techniques, and discrimi-
nation prevention algorithms in data mining. The bibliography section includes 262
references, half of which appeared in the last five years (2007-2011). This demon-
strates a never-ending interest on the topic of discrimination data analysis.
