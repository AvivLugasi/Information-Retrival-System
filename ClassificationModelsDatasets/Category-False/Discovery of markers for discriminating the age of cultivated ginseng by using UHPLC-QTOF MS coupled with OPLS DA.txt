ARTICLE INFO ABSTRACT

Keywords: Background: Ginseng (Ginseng Radix et Rhizoma, Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer) is gaining more publicity in modern
Panax ginseng society due to its health benefit and huge value in market. In the practice of grading and pricing of ginseng, the
Age discrimination age is one of the major factor influencing the price and grade of ginseng. Therefore, the age discrimination is an
LC-MS

important task for the quality control of ginseng. However, the traditional morphological methods are too
subjective to be reproductive in discrimination.

Purpose: To establish a method that can discriminate the ginseng samples with different cultivation years.
Study Design: To analyze the correlation between chemical compositions and cultivation years of cultivated
ginseng samples of different age and thus discover potential quality marker (Q-marker) for discriminating the
age of cultivated ginseng.

Methods: In the present study, the ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with the quadrupole-
time of flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF/MS) were utilized for the age discrimination and marker dis-
covery. A statistical data processing procedure was established to screen markers and reduce the false positive
rate.

Results: The results showed that the ginseng samples from 2- to 6-year-old could be well separated in the or-
thogonal projections on the latent structure - discrimination analysis (OPLS-DA) using the markers screened by
the established statistical procedure, which could reduce approximately 20% of the insignificant markers and
false positive discoveries. Ultimately, more than 50 compounds contributing to the age discrimination were
identified including one new compound (malonylginsenoside). One negative marker (1038.4825@8.98) was
discovered for the 2-year-old ginseng, and an equation was established to effectively predict the age of 3- to 6-
year-old of ginseng.

Conclusion: The constructed method can discriminate the ginseng samples with different cultivation years and is
a complement to the traditional discrimination method of ginseng age.

mind, reduce stress, enhance body functions and promote longevity
(Coleman et al., 2003; Vogler et al., 1999; Xiang et al., 2008). The
quality of ginseng is regarded to be influenced by many agronomic
conditions e.g. age, cultivars, soil, climate, medicinal parts, growing
sites, cultivation methods, phenology, and post-harvest processing
(Chung et al., 2012; Kang et al., 2008a; Kang et al., 2008b; Lim et al.,
2005; Qian et al., 2009; Qiu et al., 2008; Qu et al., 2009; Shi et al.,
2007; Xie et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2012).

The age is one of the major factors to influence the price and grade
of ginseng. In the past decade, lots of literatures have reported the in-
fluence of the age to the quality of ginseng. For instance, the content of
ginsenoside Rg1, Re, Rb1, Re, Rd, Re, Rf, Rb2, Rb3, and Rg2 increased
with the age (1-6 year-old)(Lee et al., 2009; Shi et al., 2007; Wang
et al., 2006). Furthermore, the lymphocyte proliferative capacity of
ginseng was also positively correlated to the age (3-6 year-old)
(Shan et al., 2014). Hence, the age is regarded as one important factor
to affect the quality of ginseng. However, the age discrimination still
remains a challenge in ginseng study. The traditional morphological
method is based on the number of joints in the rhizome. Several newly
developed morphological methods have been reported, for instance by
counting the starch grain inside the main root using the microscope
(Shi-Yi et al., 2013), measuring the area of phloem and xylem
(Cheng et al., 2016) using the micro-computed tomography (micro CT),
and determining the length of telomeric terminal restriction fragment
(TRF) (Liang et al., 2015) . However, the morphological inspection is
reported too subjective to be reproductive. It was reported that even the
same ginseng sample, the morphological authentication carried out by
different operators could displayed different results (Yap et al., 2008).
It's even more difficult to discriminate the ginsengs by using the mor-
phological approaches when the raw materials have been deeply pro-
cessed into products, whereas the liquid chromatography-mass spec-
trometry (LC-MS) coupled with the multivariate analysis has been
reported effective (Huang et al., 2017). Recently, the LC-MS and nu-
clear magnetic resonance (NMR) coupled with the orthogonal projec-
tions on the latent structure-discrimination analysis (OPLS-DA) had
been applied in the discrimination of the geographical origin and the
age of ginseng (Lee et al., 2011; Song et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2012).

Since the data from omics study is hyper-dimensional, the data
processing could significantly influence the decision-making. However,
based on our literature study, the marker discovery focusing on ginseng
or other herbal medicinal materials usually lack suitable method for
data process and error control. The peak area alignment, missing value,
unusual value, data distribution, significance testing, and false dis-
covery rate (FDR)(Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) controlling were
absent from most of these studies. The influence of lacking suitable data

process and error control could be significant.

In the present study, the ultra-high performance liquid chromato-
graphy coupled with the quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry
(UHPLC-QTOF/MS) was employed to obtain the metabolite data and
identify the markers. A statistical testing procedure was established to
control the error level especially the false positive rate in marker dis-
covery. This statistical procedure could reduce approximate 20% of the
insignificant and false positive markers for the marker discovery. The 2-
to 6-year-old ginsengs were well separated in the OPLS-DA model by
using the markers screened in the constructed statistical procedure.
Compared to the reported studies, the present study not only high-
lighted the important markers by using the OPLS-DA and statistical
testing, but also uncovered a conclusive marker for 2-year-old ginseng
and a prediction equation for ginseng aged 3 to 6 years, providing more
accurate conclusion and better potential in utilization in ginseng in-
dustry. The markers discovered in this study have fulfilled the re-
quirement of quality marker (Q-marker) proposed in the influential
reviews (Liu et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2016), including (1) originated from
the herb, (2) related to the efficacy, (3) qualitative analysis for quality
control, (4) are traceable. Due to no Q-marker has been reported for the
ginseng cultivation age, this study could provide systematic informa-
tion of the plant metabolomics and marker discovery for ginseng age
study.

Materials and methods
Chemicals

Acetonitrile (Mass grade) and formic acid (Mass grade) were pur-
chased from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany). The ultra-pure water
was prepared by the Milli-Q water purification system (Millipore,
Bedford, MA, USA).

Plant material

The fresh ginseng roots were collected in the GAP farms located in
Fusong (Jilin province, China), Ji-an (Jilin province, China), and
Changbai (Jilin Province, China), respectively (Table 1). The samples
aged from 2- to 6-year-old. All the samples were kept in ice before
transported to the laboratory. The roots of each sample were washed
with distilled water to remove adhered soil particles. The fresh samples
were stored at — 40 °C before the drying process. The fresh roots were
dried outdoor by sunlight for 6 days, about 9h per day, and then dried
in the oven at 40 °C for 24h. The sample drying is carried out in autumn
at Macau. The drying duration might be different according to the
B.-M. Huang et al.

weather of different locations. The end point of the drying process is the
water content stipulated in the Chinese Pharmacopeia. The water
content was detected by a moisture balance (Sartorius MA100, Got-
tingen, Germany) and required to be lower than 12.0%, which was
according to Chinese Pharmacopeia (Edition 2015) for white ginseng.

Sample preparation

The dried roots were powdered to homogeneous size in a mill,
sieved through a 40-mesh sieve. The sample powder (approximately
0.5 g) was accurately weighted in a centrifugal tube (50 ml, PP-single
use; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and shaken vigor-
ously after the addition of 12.5ml of 70% ethanol (water-ethanol,
30-70). Extraction was performed in an ultrasonic cleaner (Model 2800
HT; Crest Ultrasonics, Trenton, NJ, USA) for 1h. After ultrasonic ex-
traction, centrifugal separation was performed for 10 min at 4000 rpm
(Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). 0.200 ml of the resulting super-
natant solution was diluted into 1.00 ml using methanol and mixed by
vortex for 15 seconds. All samples were filtered through a 0.22 um
syringe filter (PTFE; Grace Davison Discovery Science, Columbia, MD,
USA) before injected into the UHPLC-MS system.

Quality control (QC) sample preparation and application

The QC sample was a pooled sample of the different batches of
ginseng extract. Two samples in individual batch were selected ran-
domly and extracted as described in the Sample preparation section.
5.0 ml of the resulting supernatant solution of each extract was pooled
and then freeze-dried (—4°C). The dried solid were store in — 40°C
until used. 0.1 g of solid was accurately weighted and dissolved in 10 ml
70% ethanol, then 0.2 ml was diluted into 1 ml using methanol and
mixed by vortex for 15 s. This solution was served as the QC sample.
The QC sample was measured approximate every 5 hours in each batch
of analysis and then used to calculate a calibration coefficient
(Chetwynd et al., 2016) as following:

G1, G2, G3... Gn are the samples measured in dayl, day2, day3.,...
dayN, and the signal intensity of compound X in these samples were X1,
X2, X3... Xn. The QC sample would be measured following these sam-
ples and the corresponding signal intensity of compound X in QC
sample are X1’, X2’, X3’... Xn’. Define the signal response level in day1
as the standard response, and then have a calibration coefficient > for
the dayN (Eq. (1)):

A = Xn'/XV (1)

Then the calibrated signal intensity of compound X in sample Gn
can be calculated by Eq. (2):

Xn (corrected) = Xn/A (2)

All the signal intensity used in this study was calibrated using Eq.

(2).
Chromatographic and TOF/MS condition

The sample determination was performed on an Agilent 1290
UHPLC coupled with Agilent 6550 Accurate Mass QTOF/MS system
(Agilent technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and the separation was
based on an ACQUITY UHPLC BEH’ shield RP18 column
(2.1mm xX 100mm, 1.7m, Waters corporation, Santa Clara, CA,
USA); A pre-column, UHPLC safe SecurityGuard ULTRA Guard car-
tridge system was used to protect the column (Waters corporation,
Santa Clara, CA, USA).

The autosampler was set at 10°C and the column temperature was
maintained at 40 °C. Water (B) - acetonitrile (A) (both the aqueous and
organic phase containing 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 0.35 ml/
min with a gradient program as follow: 25-43% A (0-14 min), 43-65%
A (14-18 min), 65-80% A (18-20min), 80-25% A (20-22 min),

Phytomedicine 45 (2018) 8-17

25-25% A (22-25 min). The mass spectrometer was operated under the
negative ionization mode with ESI iron source and the following set-
tings: drying gas, N2; gas temperature, 325°C; gas flow, 8.0 1/min;
nebulizer, 35 psi; VCap, 3500 v; nozzle voltage, 1000 v; Fragmentor,
300 v; CID: 30 v. The molecule mass accuracy and reproducibility were
maintained by using the independent reference lock-mass ions (API-
TOF Reference Mass Solution Kit, G1969-85,001, Agilent
Technologies).

MS data alignment and matching

The data mining was carried out by using an automated algorithm
(Find by Molecular Feature) based on the Masshunter Quantitative
Analysis B.06.00 software (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA,
USA). The data mining conditions are as follow: retention time (RT)
range from 0-25 min; peak height > 1000 counts; maximum charge 5;
ion species: negative ([M-H], [M+HCOO], and [M+Cl]); compound
quality score > = 80.00; compound ion count threshold: two or more
ions. The compounds were automatically matched among different
samples based on Mass Profiling Professional software (Agilent
Technologies), where the molecular mass tolerance was < 0.01
Da + 5ppm, and retention time tolerance < 0.5min + 5ppm. Each
compound was characterized by RT, accurate mass and signal intensity.
The total ion chromatogram (TIC) scan spectra of the typical ginseng
samples (cultivated ginseng) from 2 to 6-year-old are shown in Fig. 1.

The statistical screening procedure

The statistical screening procedure was performed on the S.A.S
software (version 9.3, SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA).

Missing value screening
The variable with a missing rate a % < 50% in at least one group
remains in the dataset, otherwise, is excluded (Zhang, 2016).

Unusual value screening

[& — X°/6, (Xe — X/8, (% — X/6..(Ky — X7/8] (3)

X;, X2, X3...Xn are the original observations of variable X, while
dataset (3) is the normalized dataset of X with the mean value = 0, and
standard deviation (SD) = 1; X’ and 6 are the mean value and SD of X.
Based on dataset (3), the unusual value is defined as the (X,- X’ )/6 > 3
or < —3. Ifa sample contains more than 50% of unusual value, then it
is excluded; otherwise, remains in the dataset.

Significant testing

Briefly, if the data follows the normal distribution (Berman, 1971),
the data goes to F-test(Donaldson, 1966), otherwise, goes to nonpara-
metric test. If the data shows variance equal in F-test, goes to Student's
t-test (Student, 1908), otherwise, goes to Welch's t-test (variance un-
equal). If the data does not follow the normal distribution, goes to the
nonparametric test (Wilcoxon test)(Blair and Higgins, 1980). The
variable declaring significant difference in t-test or Wilcoxon test goes
to FDR controlling, otherwise, is excluded. All the significant testing is
under the significant level of p = 0.05.

FDR controlling

Benjamini-Hochberg step-up procedure is applied. The FDR con-
trolling level a is 0.05. H1... Hm are the null hypotheses rejected in t
test or nonparametric test, p1...pm their corresponding p-values. Then
the p-values are ordered in increasing order and denoted by p1’... pm’.
Find the largest k’ that fulfills p (k’) < = x a, then reject the null hy-
potheses for all H(i’) for i’? = 1’, ..., k’. mis the null hypotheses number
for corrected. Then variables X(?’) for i’ = 1’, ..., k’ goes to OPLS-DA.

Principal components analysis (PCA) and OPLS-DA

The PCA and OPLS-DA were performed on the SIMCA 13.0 package
(Umetrics, Umea, Sweden). The ellipse in the model plane is defined as
the 95% critical limit of the Hotelling T? for both of these two models.
The 99% critical limit of the Hotelling T° is define as the threshold of
the serious outliers in the PCA to exclude the unusual samples. OPLS-
DA parameter R2X describes how much of the variation in the X vari-
able could be explained by the selected components. R2 describes how
well the model is fitted. Q2 describes how well the X could predict the
Y. The R2 and Q2 range from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates perfect fitness
and predictivity. The root mean square error of cross-validation

(RMSECV) also describes the predictive power but by comparing the
original observed Y and the predicted Y in the measure unit. The OPLS-
DA model is constructed based on the internal 7-fold cross-validation.
The data is mean-centered and scaled to unit variance (UV) by the
SIMCA software. The variable importance of projection (VIP) is the
vector to summarize the total importance of the variable in explaining
the model. If a variable with the VIP > 1.0, it also has to fulfill one of
the three decision rules, otherwise, is excluded.

a. VIP value ranks within 20.
b. Peak area ranks within 20.

Results
The statistical screening procedure

In the present study, a statistical procedure was established to
control the error level of the data including the missing value, unusual
value, data distribution, classis statistical significance test, and FDR
controlling. The missing value threshold, unusual value threshold, and
FDR controlling would be applied in a different way compared to other
plant metabolomics studies.

Due to the missing value could influence the data distribution, the
missing rate cut-off was usually introduced to the omics data. In the
present study, the cut-off threshold for missing data was a% > 50.0%
missing (Rubert et al., 2016). However, the value is not missing com-
pletely at random (Jing, 2012), which means the probability of miss-
ingness is the same for all units. For instance, the Araloside A/Chiku-
setsusaponin Ib (926.4872 Da, RT = 8.90 min) showed 95.0% missing
in 2-year-old ginseng but only 22.7% in 6-year-old group, whereas the
total missing rate based on the five age groups was 59.6%. The results
showed that the missing rate decreased gradually from 2- to 6-year-old
(95.0, 76.9, 55.8, 47.8, and 22.7%, respectively) indicating the accu-
mulation of this compound is age correlated. Therefore, the missing
rate was calculated based on individual age groups, and only the
variable displayed the missing rate a% > 50.0% in individual age
groups being excluded. The unusual value could significant influence
the mean value of the population and therefore influence the prediction
in the regression model. Therefore, a threshold was also set in present
study to exclude the unusual value ( > 3SD or < —3SD, based on the
normalization dataset). Similar to the missingness screening, the unu-
sual value was also defined based on individual groups.

The studies focusing on marker discovery of ginseng or other plant
materials mostly ignored the accumulation of the type I error in their
experiments. For a dataset including dozens or even hundreds of null
hypotheses, it is very likely to include the false discoveries. In this
study, the FDR (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) controlling was in-
troduced to control the type I error due to more than 500 null hy-
potheses would be carried out in our experiment. For instance, for the
comparison of the 5- and 6-year-old ginsengs, there were 148 com-
pounds declared significance (p < 0.05). But merely 80 null hypotheses
still declared significance after the FDR correction at the level of 0.05
(Benjamini-Hochberg step-up procedure), whereas 68 compounds were
regarded as false positive under the defined control level. Noted that
the FDR control level was scalable. However, a higher control level (like
0.1) was less conservative in including markers but at the cost of re-
ducing the power of controlling the type I error. Generally, the estab-
lished statistical procedure could reduce approximate 20% of the in-
significant and false positive variable for the further multivariate
analyses.

The chemometric analysis

PCA

Compared to the supervised method, the unsupervised method is
more likely to provide the clustering similar to the natural grouping of
the samples used to exclude the outliers. In the preliminary experiment,
17 serious outliers (> 99.0% Hotelling T? critical limit) were excluded
from the dataset. In the constructed PCA model, the 12 principal
components explained 54.3% of the total variation (PC1 described
13.2% of the sample variability, and 6.8% for PC2). The first two
components merely described 20.0% of the total variation, indicating
the two major principal components could not explain the major aspect
of the data. Therefore, in the PCA score plot (Fig. 2A), the different age
groups were remarkably overlapped despite the high level of fitting
being applied. The overlap was caused by the similarity within the

Phytomedicine 45 (2018) 8-17

species, which had been claimed in other study based on the gene
barcoding approach (Nguyen et al., 2016). However, the mean posi-
tions of the 5 age groups showed that, except the 4- and 5-year-old
ginsengs are extremely similar, the mean positions of the other three
groups could be separated from each other (Fig. 2B). These results in-
dicated that, the unsupervised method was not appropriable for the
samples with larger within-class divergence. To uncover the underlying
difference, the supervised method OPLS-DA was applied.

OPLS-DA

The OPLS-DA extends an regression of the PCA and uses the class
membership to maximize the variation and introduce an orthogonal
signal correction (OSC) filter to separately handle the systematic var-
iation correlated to or uncorrelated to the Y variable, and therefore has
better discriminant ability for the samples with larger within-class di-
vergence than PCA (Bylesjé et al., 2006). In the present study, 5 age
groups were clearly separated in the OPLS-DA score plot in two steps,
where the separation of the 2- and 6-year-old groups was in the first
step (Fig. 3A), and the other three groups in the second step (Fig. 3B).
The R2X of the two steps of OPLS-DA model was approximately 0.5
indicating 50% of the variation in the dataset could be modeled by the
selected components. The R2 of the two steps of OPLS-DA model ranged
from 0.741 to 0.893 indicating the model was well fitted. The Q2
ranged from 0.3 to 0.4 not indicating a very good predictivity, it was
possibly caused by the within-class divergence of individual groups.
The RMSECV is to evaluate the deviation between the predicted and
observed Y values by summarizing the cross-validation residuals of the
observations in the workset in measurement unit (Yang et al., 2012).
The RMSECV of the 2- and 6-year-old group is 0.16 and 0.29, respec-
tively, corresponding to 1.95 and 3.51 months deviation between the
predicted and observed age. However, the RMSECV of the 3-, 4- and 5-
year groups ranged from 0.32 to 0.39 corresponding to 3.84 to 4.86
months deviation in predicting the age. The similarity of the 3-, 4- and
5-year groups reduces the predictive power of the model. Therefore, the
3-, 4-, and 5-year-old groups needed to be separated in an additional
step after the removal of the 2- and 6-year-old groups.

The potential markers

The markers were included based on the ranking of the VIP values
in OPLS-DA model, the relative signal intensity, and structural assign-
ment in MS/MS. Then the potential markers were discussed in two steps
corresponding to the two steps of OPLS-DA separation, where the 3-, 4-
and 5-year-old groups were regarded as one group in the first step
(termed with middle age). As can be seen, the content (relative signal
intensity, %) of the potential markers majorly increased with the age.
The content of the all markers, sugar (sucrose and glucopyranosyl-
glucopyranosyl-rhamnose), organic acid (p-coumaroyl quinic acid and
10-hydroxy-4, 6-decadiynoic acid), lipid (gingerglycolipid B), and
unidentified markers in 6-year-old ginseng are significantly higher
(3.55% to 64.38%) than that in 2-year-old and middle age ginsengs
(Fig. 5A), whereas the content of amino acid (N?-Fructopyr-
anosylarginine) and ginsenosides in the middle age was significantly
higher (8.47% to 84.97%) the 2- and 6-year-old ginsengs. The sugar
accumulation showed highly linear response (R? > 0.9) against the age.
Though sucrose was the most abundant marker (occupied 52.48 to
53.93% of the total content of the markers) and had been reported an
important marker in other literatures (Kang et al., 2008a; Yang et al.,
2012), but it was not the most contributing variable in OPLS-DA se-
paration (VIP ranked 41). However, the content of two malonyl-gin-
senosides decreased with the age (Fig. 4A and 4B). The content of the
malonylginsenoside Rd and malonylginsenoside Rc/Rb2 in middle age
and 6-year-old ginseng was 65.17 to 87.28, and 51.58 to 58.83% lower
than the 2-year-old ginseng, respectively. For the first step separation,
23.64% of the potential markers reached the peak content in 2-year-old,
21.82% in middle age, and 54.55% in 6-year-old. Within the middle age

Fig. 3. The OPLS-DA score plot of the five age groups of ginseng. (A) The OPLS-DA score plot of 2- to 6-year-old ginsengs (four predictive and ten orthogonal components, R?X = 0.503,
R= 0.741, ee = 0.372) covering the three major cultivars in China (Biantiao, Damaya, and Fuxing Yihao) and from three cultivation sites (Fusong, Ji-an, and Changbai). (B) The OPLS-

group, all the chemical species reached the peak content in 5-year-old
except the unidentified markers (Fig. 5B). Merely the content of the
organic acid and amino acid was significantly different among the three
groups. The content of organic acid and amino acid in 3-year-old gin-
seng was 18.39 to 33.63%, and 30.00 to 78.14% lower than the 4- and
5-year-old ginseng, respectively.

One compound with 1038.4825@8.98 (probably saponin) could not
be detected in 2-year-old ginseng, and therefore could be a negative
conclusive marker for the 2-year-old ginseng.

The prediction of the age of ginseng

Except the negative marker 1038.4825@8.98 for 2-year-old gin-
seng, no conclusive marker was discovered for other age groups.
Therefore, an equation was developed by using the total content of the
markers contributed in both of the two steps of OPLS-DA separation (35
compounds, marked with * in Fig. 4A). The equation is
y = 4,518,464.5744 x + 35,058,130.2867 (R* = 0.9790); wherein y
represents the peak area, and x represents the age. To validate the ac-
curacy, the age of 12 samples were predicted by using this equation.
The recorded age (age recorded by suppliers) and the predicted age are
showed in Table 2. The results showed that the deviation of the pre-
dicted age and recorded age is less than 0.35 year for all samples,
whereas 0.6 year for the 4-year-old group. The reason is one sample of
the 4-year-old ginseng displayed large within-class divergence and then
influences the prediction accuracy. Generally, the age of 91.7% samples
could be predicted with acceptable accuracy by using this equation. To
enhance the ability to identify the unusual sample and develop the
strategy to handle these unusual samples more properly would be an
important task for the future study.

The identification of the markers

The potential markers discovered in present study were identified
using the UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS. More than 50% of the identified markers
were ginsenosides (Supporting information Table $1). One malonyl-
ginsenoside was supposed to be a new compound. The accurate mole-
cular mass of new compound 1 (Fig. 6) is 1118.5509 Da (named new
compound 1 in this study), there are three known compounds sharing
the same molecular mass in the database i.e. Dictionary of Natural
Products (Copyright © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group), SciFinder
(Copyright © 2015 American Chemical Society), and Metlin (Copyright
© 2015 The Scripps Research Institute). One of these three known
compounds originated from the genus Panax. However, based on the
fragments in the MS/MS spectrum of new compound-1, there were two
free-malonyl-groups in the molecule, the ion fragments of [M-HCOO],
[M-2COO-H],, [M-malonyl-H],, and [M-2malonyl-H]° confirmed this
structure. The three known compounds do not have two free-malonyl-
groups. Furthermore, the ion fragments showed that new compound 1
had three molecules of glucose/galactose, and a PPD aglycone skeleton.
The detail of the ionic fragmentation of new compound 1 is showed in
Fig. 6.

Discussion

Since the poor reproducibility of the morphological method is re-
ported, the LC-based method would outperform the traditional method
due to the better sensitivity, accuracy and reproducibility. Compared to
the microscope approach, the constructed method requires merely little
amount of sample. In this study, the actual sample amount injected into
the LC-MS is only 40 ng (0.5 g / 25ml/5 x 1 pl). Therefore, the con-
structed method has more potential for the identification of the pre-
cious sample.

In the reported studies, the similar approaches using the LC-MS

coupled with the multivariate analysis for ginseng age. However, no
conclusive markers had been reported prior to this study. These studies
mostly focused on the discrimination model but not the marker dis-
covery. The discrimination relying on multivariate analysis model
would limit its application in the ginseng quality control due to its
needs to measure hundreds of metabolites and reduce the reproduci-
bility of the method. The present study discovered one conclusive
marker and developed a prediction equation for ginseng age prediction.
It would be simple to apply in ginseng age discrimination. Furthermore,
we introduced the statistical screening procedure to include the

significant markers prior to the multivariate analysis and reduce the
false positive rate in the discoveries. The statistical testing is crucial but
yet not attract enough attention in plant metabolomics area. This study
might be a hint for other researchers to understand the statistical testing
used in omics study.

Recently, the NMR approach has been reported for ginseng age
discrimination. In these literatures, the NMR coupled with the PLS-DA
model was effective for the discrimination of the 2-6 year-old ginsengs.
However, in the NMR-based method, the signals used for the multi-
variate analysis mostly origniated from the high abundant compounds

such as sugars (sucrose, glucose, xylose etc.), organic acid (acetate,
glutarate, malate etc.), and amino acid (valine, threonine, arginine,
glutamine ete.) (Nguyen et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2012), but no ginseng
saponin was reported. In the NMR spectrum of the ginseng extract, the
low abundant active components of ginseng saponins was overlapped
by the high abundant components. Furthermore, the signal overlap in
NMR could also significantly influence the signal accuracy. Therefore,
LC-MS had certain degree of advantages in ginseng metabolomics study
compared to the reported NMR-based method.

In the present study, the UHPLC-QTOF/MS was used to obtain the
metabolomics data of ginseng and served as the raw data to screen the
potential markers for age prediction. The statistical procedure was
crucial for the entire protocol. The established statistical procedure
reduced approximate 20% of the insignificant and false positive

variables for the further multivariate analysis. The ginsengs from 2- to
6-year-old were clearly separated in a two-step OPLS-DA separation by
using the variables screened in the statistical procedure. Ultimately, one
negative marker (1038.4825@8.98) was discovered for the 2-year-old
ginseng. An equation y = 4,518,464.5744 x + 35,058,130.2867
(R? = 0.9790) was developed by the total content of 35 important
markers to predict the age of the 3- to 6-year-old. The age of 91.7%
samples could be predicted using this equation with acceptable accu-
racy.

Since the new concept of Q-marker has been introduced in 2016
(Liu et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2016), it provides an new idea for the
marker selection for quality control of traditional Chinese medicine
(TCM). The Q-marker for TCM was significantly different from the
marker used for chemical drugs. (1) The Q-marker should originate
from the herb. The markers discovered for ginseng in this study all
existed in ginseng, furthermore, the ginsenosides mostly existed in the
genus Panax; (2) the Q-markers should be associated with the efficacy.
The ginsenosides highlighted in this study occupied more than 50% of
the markers. As we all knew, the ginsenosides are the major active
components in ginseng. (3) The Q-marker should be quantitative or
qualitative analysis. In this study, the markers were measured using the
LC-MS, and all the signal intensities were calibrated by using an ex-
ternal standard, the QC sample. It made the signal intensity comparable
among the pile of samples. It was a semi-quantitative method to provide
the accurate relative content of these markers. (4) The Q-marker should
be traceable in the quality control process. It required the markers
having certain degree of stability to maintain in the decoction pieces or
even the deeply processed product. In this study, the result had in-
dicated that these markers were detectable in all the ginseng herb
samples (except the negative marker), and our other study had used the
similar method for the quality control of the deeply processed ginseng
products (Huang et al., 2017). Therefore, these markers were supposed
to be feasible throughout the entire “Resource-Pieces-Processing-Ex-
tract” to product. But there are several shortcomings in this method.

Too many markers involved in the prediction equation that may lead to
more uncertainty of the method. It should reduce the number of mar-
kers used in the equation even finally only one or two markers being
used like the marker used for clinical diagnosis. Another shortcoming is
that the accurate contents of these markers had not been measured. The
relative content of markers generally could not reflect the real quality
of TCM due to the dose-effect relationship is also a basic principle for
TCM. Conclusively, although some shortcomings were still observed in
the conducted method, it still showed the efficacy and potential ap-
plication in the quality control of ginseng.
