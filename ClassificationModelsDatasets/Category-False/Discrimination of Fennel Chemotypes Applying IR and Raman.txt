ABSTRACT: Various vibrational spectroscopy methods have been applied to classify different fennel chemotypes according
to their individual profile of volatile substances. Intact fennel fruits of different chemotypes could be successfully discriminated
by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) and near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. Solvent extracts
(CCl,) of the considered fennel fruits showed characteristic fingerprints with marker bands related to the individual volatile
components (trans-anethole, fenchone, estragole, piperitenone oxide, y-asarone, limonene) for ATR-FTIR and FT-Raman spec-
troscopy. Especially ycic and Yc—o absorption bands contribute to the different spectral profiles. On the basis of hierarchical
cluster analysis, the considered fennel accessions were classified according to gas chromatographic (GC) and vibrational
spectroscopic data. Furthermore, even a discrimination of “sweet” and “bitter” fennel fruits, both belonging to the trans-anethole
chemotype, could be successfully performed. All vibrational spectroscopical techniques used in this study are rapid and easy to
apply. Hence, they allow different fennel chemotypes to be reliably distinguished and can also be used for on-site measurement in

free nature.

HB INTRODUCTION

Fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill.) is cultivated worldwide for
its characteristic aromatic leaves and fruits and represents one
of the most important plant species in the genus Foeniculum.
The species shows a large diversity from both morphological
and chemical points of view. In this context two subspecies
(subsp. piperitum and subsp. vulgare) and three varieties (var.
vulgare, var. dulce, and var. azoricum) have been described in the
literature.’ The fruits of var. vulgare and var. dulce have been
entered in the European Pharmacopeia, but unfortunately it is
impossible to discriminate these varieties by their outer
appearance.” Also, other fennel genotypes cannot be described
exactly in relation to only morphological data. However, in the
past, several different chemotypes have been identified for
which the essential oil composition can be identified easily by
applying gas chromatography—mass spectrometry (GC-MS)2-5
Detailed specifications for fennel essential oils are described in
the Food Chemical Codex (ECC)* as well as by the Inter-
national Standard Organization (ISO 17412-2007, oil of bitter
fennel). Furthermore, it is well-known that the aromatic
character of each fennel chemotype depends predominantly on
the individual composition of the volatile substances. Generally,
chemotypes are classified on the basis of their prevalent
compounds, but it is also known that the composition of the
essential oil is largely influenced by the vegetative stage of the
individual fennel plant.”

The application of GC-MS methods provides reliable infor-
mation for the identification of the individual chemotype and

the precise quantification of individual essential oil compo-
nents. However, with regard to the aspects of efficient quality
control and “good manufacturing practice”, in most cases gas
chromatography is not suitable enough due to the analysis time
required and should be therefore replaced by more efficient,
rapid, and robust analytical methods. Furthermore, there exists
an increasing demand in the context of plant breeding to apply
nondestructive methods for fast selection of high-quality fennel
single plants. In recent years, numerous mid-infrared (IR),
near-infrared (NIR), and Raman spectroscopy methods have
been established for various quality control purposes* *° in the
area of medicinal and aromatic plants also aiming to distinguish
different species or chemotypes''~" and to predict the content
of valuable plant substances directly in the drug or in the iso-
lated volatile fractions.'*~ However, up to now no attempts
have been made to use these efficient methods for the dis-
crimination and characterization of different fennel chemotypes
and the extracts obtained from them.

The noninvasive character of vibrational spectroscopic anal-
ysis might be of special interest for breeding purposes, where an
authentic identification of the chemotype or a quantification of
the main essential oil components without any damage to the
fruits is required. Beyond that, an application of fast analysis for

reliable differentiation of bitter and sweet fennel is beneficial for
pharmaceutical quality control, because both fennel types are
included in the European Pharmacopoeia and possess different
applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries. 7-19
Therefore, the aim of this work was to develop new rapid and
easy to perform analytical methods based on vibrational spec-
troscopy techniques (IR, NIR, and Raman) allowing a reliable
discrimination of different wild fennel chemotypes occurring in
nature. Furthermore, it was aimed to determine simultaneously
the individual content of valuable substances in fennel fruits
without the necessity of performing any sample preparation.

In this context a new chemotype of fennel, the essential oil of
which is dominated by the phenylpropanoid y-asarone, was dis-
covered for the first time and characterized by GC-MS, nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR), and IR spectroscopy.

HM MATERIALS AND METHODS

Chemicals. Pure standard substances (trans-anethole, a-pinene,
p-cymene, limonene, fenchone, estragole, anisaldehyde, a-asarone, and
B-asarone, all >98%; myrcene, 95%; y-terpinene, 97%) were purchased
as analytical standards for terpene analysis or GC reference from Roth
(Karlsruhe, Germany) and Sigma-Aldrich (Taufkirchen, Germany),
respectively. All other reagents were of analytical grade and used
without further purification.

Plant Material. Fruits of different fennel accessions were provided
by the Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research in
Gatersleben (IPK) and of the Federal Plant Variety Office in Dachwig
(Germany). For further botanical description (as far as obtainable) see

Reference GC-FID and GC-MS Analyses. Approximately 200 mg
of air-dried fennel fruits was homogenized in 10 mL of CCL, with an
Ultra Turrax T25 blender for 1 min. Each accession was extracted
twice, and the individual extracts were subsequently analyzed after
centrifugation (4 min at 2415 g) by gas chromatography—flame
ionization detection (GC-FID) using an Agilent gas chromatograph
6890N, fitted with an HP-5 column (50 m xXx 0.32 mm id, film
thickness = 0.52 ym). This GC instrument is routinely used for
essential oil analysis and continuously validated with external
standards. Hence, no repeat determination was performed and each
sample was investigated once. Detector and injector temperatures were
set at 280 and 250 °C, respectively. The following oven temperature
program was used: heating from 80 to 220 °C at a rate of 8 °C/min.
This final temperature was held for 10 min. Carrier gas was hydrogen

3538

with a constant flow rate of 1 mL/min (split = 1:20). GC-MS analyses
of the fennel extracts were performed using an Agilent MSD 5972/HP
5890 series II, equipped with a 30 m X 0.25 mm id, 0.5 zm, HP-SMS
column. Column temperature was programmed from 60 to 120 °C
at a rate of 3 °C/min, increased to 220 °C at 8 °C/min, and held for
10 min. Carrier gas was helium with a constant flow rate of 1.1 mL/min
and a split of 1:10. Injector and detector temperatures were set at
250 and 280 °C, respectively. The ionization energy was set at 70 eV.
Identification of the detected compounds was based on their relative
retention times and their mass spectra in comparison with those
observed for the above-mentioned pure standard substances. The
other compounds were tentatively identified by using the NBS75K and
Wiley 138 library databases of the GC-MS system. The percentage
composition of the volatile fraction was computed from the GC peak
areas according to the 100% method without using any correction
factors. Identification and structural determination of y-asarone were
performed on the basis of the MS fragmentation patterns compared to
authenticated standards (a- and f-asarone).

For further analysis, the essential oil of FOE 87 was obtained by
hydrodistillation of approximately 2 g of fennel fruits.

Vibrational Spectroscopic Measurements. Besides the above-
mentioned terpenoid standards and the intact fennel fruits, also sol-
vent extracts of fennel fruits were investigated by Raman and ATR-FTIR
spectroscopy. These extracts were produced following the protocol
described under Reference GC-FID and GC-MS Analyses.

ATR-FTIR Spectroscopy. MIR spectra of intact fennel fruits, CCL,
solvent extracts, and pure standards were recorded in the wave-
number range from 4000 to 375 cm‘ with a portable ATR diamond
crystal infrared spectrometer (Alpha, Bruker Optics GmbH, Ettlingen,
Germany). Approximately S—10 mg of the standards was placed on
the surface of the diamond crystal and directly measured. One hun-
dred microliters of the solvent extracts was applied dropwise on the
diamond crystal, and the spectra were recorded after evaporation of
the solvent (observation of the disappearing CCL, absorption bands).
Intact fennel fruits were measured under gently pressure with the
interior side directed to the crystal, keeping the pressure constant for
all measurements and avoiding damage to the fruits. All spectra were
composed of 32 scans with a spectral resolution of 4 em™'. Each
sample was measured triply, and the resulting triplicates were finally
averaged and used for later chemometric calculations.

Identification and structural determination of y-asarone were
performed by comparing the ATR-FTIR spectrum of purified
y-asarone with the @- and f-asarone standard. Pure y-asarone was
obtained by thin layer chromatography (TLC) of the extract of
accession FOE 87 prepared for GC-MS. TLC was performed at TLC-
aluminum sheets coated with silica gel 60 F254 (layer thickness of
0.2 mm) obtained from Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. As mobile
phase a solvent mixture of chloroform and hexane at the volume ratio
of 3:1 was used. The relatively low amount of purified y-asarone was
completely used for ATR-FTIR analyses.

NIR Spectroscopy. NIR analyses were performed in the range from
12500 to 3600 cm” with a spectral resolution of 8 cm™' on an FT-NIR
spectrometer (Multi Purpose Analyzer, Bruker Optics). Approximately
0.5 g of fennel fruits was loosely packed in glass cuvettes, and the resulting
spectra were collected during 32 scans; the raw spectra were corrected for
the effects resulting from scatter and baseline drift using the weighted
multiplicative scatter correction algorithm (WMSC) of the OPUS 6.5
software (Bruker GmbH, Germany). Each sample was analyzed with
three-fold repetition followed by averaging of the triplicates. Averaged
spectra were exclusively used for the subsequent chemometric evaluation.

FT-Raman Spectroscopy. Raman spectra were recorded on a
Bruker RFS 1008S with a diode-pumped Nd:YAG laser, emitting at
1064 nm, and a germanium detector cooled with liquid nitrogen. All spectra
were measured with a resolution of 4 cm™ in the range from 4000 to
100 cm™ with a laser power of 500 mW supplied by a focused laser spot
size of 100 jam in diameter. The fennel extracts were directly measured in
solution in glass vials and the spectra were accumulated from 64 scans. As
far as the samples were measured in liquid solution, no measurement
replications were performed, and each sample was analyzed only once.

Because of high fluorescence appearance at lower laser energy and
burning of the sample by increasing energy, it was unfortunately not
possible to obtain meaningful Raman spectra of the fennel fruits.
Hence, only the extracts were analyzed by Raman spectroscopy.

(CDCk, Deutero GmbH, Germany) and investigated by 'H and °C
NMR without previous purification.

The 'H NMR (200 MHz) and the '3C spectrum (50 MHz) were
recorded on a Varian Gemini 2000), both at 298 K. The chemical
shifts, 6, are given in parts per million. The solvent signals of CDCI,
were used for internal calibration and appeared at 5 7.26 ('H) and 6
77.16 (8C), respectively.

Additionally, the BC spectrum of y-asarone was calculated using
ADS software (Advanced Chemistry Development Inc., Toronto, ON,
Canada), and the theoretical signals were compared to the experi-
mentally determined results.

Chemometrics. For estimating the variability of the samples,
hierarchical cluster analysis (Ward’s algorithm) was applied under
usage of the instrument software OPUS 6.5 (Bruker, Germany).

Relevant spectral ranges were determined by comparison of sample
spectra with those of appropriate standards and by principal com-
ponent analysis (PCA).

MH RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The molecular structures of the most important volatile sub-
stances occurring in the analyzed fennel fruits are presented in

3541

Figure 1, whereas Table 2 shows the mean values for the most
important volatile components as determined by GC-FID.

As can be seen in Table 2, each genotype shows an individual
metabolic profile in the volatile fraction and can be classified
into different groups according to its main component(s).

Except accession FOE 25, all considered fennel fruits con-
tained fenchone in the concentration range between 6.29 and
35.08% in the solvent extracts and are dominated by at least
one phenylpropanoid species as the main component, either
trans-anethole or estragole.

In contrast, the CCl, extract of FOE 25 is dominated by
nearly 47% of limonene and 29% of piperitenone oxide. The
identification of piperitenone oxide has already been performed
earlier by Badoc et al. on the basis of GC—high resolution MS
data using the same fennel subspecies (F. vulgare sp. piperitum,
Table 1). Accordingly, this accession is assigned to the
piperitenone/piperitenone oxide chemotype.**

FOE 86 and FOE 87, also contain high amounts of a
phenylpropanoid substance, but neither estragole nor trans-
anethole could be detected in these samples by GC-MS or
vibrational spectroscopy. Nevertheless, the MS data clearly
showed a structural relationship to estragole and trans-anethole,
but indicates a higher substitution of the aromatic ring system
with three methoxy groups (Figure 2).

The molecular ion M* with m/z 208 indicates three methoxy
groups as substituents at the aromatic ring. Comparison of
the mass spectra of a@- and f-asarone standards with those of the un-
known component in FOE 86 and FOE 87 shows a higher frag-
ment at m/z 177 (M — 31)*) for the extract (Figure 2,
bottom). This is caused by the higher fragmentation tendency
of the ring system at the methoxy groups (—31 m/z) in the
extract compared to a- and f-asarone. With the conjugated side
chain in a- and f-asarone, fragmentation appears more at the
C3 substituent as shown in the relatively low intensity of
fragment m/z 177 (Figure 2, top and middle).

The corresponding ATR-FTIR spectrum additionally showed
an allylic character of the aliphatic C=C double bond similar
to that of estragole (Figure 3).

Hence, under usage of GC-MS and ATR-FTIR and in com-
parison to a- and f-asarone as commercially available stan-
dards, the structure of the unknown compound was proposed

3542

as y-asarone (Figure 1), which is already known to be present in
the essential oil of various plant species and for its fungitoxic
and antibacterial activity.“°-**

The cis—trans isomers a-asarone and f-asarone themselves
could be excluded as the unknown phenylpropanoid, as the
results from ATR-FTIR clearly manifest the allyl substituent at
the aromatic ring.

To prove the suggestion of the y-asarone structure, 1H and
BC NMR experiments of the pure essential oil of FOE 87 were
performed. Because of the relatively high concentration of this
compound of about 70% in the essential oil fraction, no prior
purification step was performed.

Figure 4 presents the results from 'H and ’C NMR as well
as from the theoretical calculation of the °C NMR spectrum.
Besides the very good correlation of theoretical and
experimental data, the signal assignment is in good accordance
with NMR data for y-asarone described in the literature.”*

The occurrence of y-asarone in F. vulgare, representing nearly
70% of the essential oil of accessions FOE 86 and FOE 87, is
described here for the first time. This is why we introduce the
name “y-asarone type” for this new fennel chemotype.

Spectroscopic Analysis. Generally, all vibrational spec-
troscopy methods applied in this study are useful for rapid and
reliable discrimination of the described fennel chemotypes.

Figure 7. Hierarchical cluster analysis of 10 different fennel accessions based on the GC-FID data (A), the ATR-FTIR spectra of the CCL, extracts
(B), the ATR-FTIR spectra of the intact fruits (C), and the Raman spectra of the CCl, extracts (D). The dashed line marks the lowest level of

complete discrimination of the individual clusters.

 

For NIR, only intact fruits were analyzed because of the small
available amounts of solvent extracts. For ATR-FTIR the ex-
tracts as well as the intact fruits were evaluated, whereas for
Raman only the extracts were analyzed (see FT-Raman
Spectroscopy). High fluorescence appearance in the spectra
along with burning of the sample under the applied laser energy
made it impossible to obtain meaningful Raman spectra with
the used spectrometer.

ATR-FTIR Spectroscopy. As presented in Table 2, all fennel
accessions contain higher amounts of a ketone (fenchone or
piperitenone oxide) and an unsaturated phenylpropanoid
substance. The high IR activity of the C—O bond resulting
in strong signals in the ATR spectra of the extracts as well as
the fennel fruits made it nearly impossible to distinguish the
different fennel chemotypes on the basis of their fenchone/
piperitenone oxide content. Figure 5 shows the ATR spectra of
the individual fennel extracts in the fingerprint region from
1850 to 600 cm™! and the corresponding reference compounds
for the main volatile components.

In nearly all fennel accessions the strong Y¥e_o absorption
band around 1742 cm! dominates the spectrum in the
fingerprint region even if the concentration of the correspond-
ing carbonyls (fenchone/piperitenone oxide) in sum averages

3543

only 7.75% (cv. Chumen). As a consequence, the strong IR
activity of this polar bond with its high dipole moment makes it
impossible to distinguish the different genotypes on the level of
their fenchone/piperitenon oxide concentration.

Besides the ketone function, the phenylpropanoids as well as
the terpenoids differ only in their carbon structure and the
presence and number of methoxy groups.

As can be easily seen when the MIR spectra of the extracts
are compared with those of the pure standards, trans-anethole
and estragole can be distinguished only by the signals resulting
from the nonaromatic C=C double bond. Because of the
resonance effect in trans-anethole, the signals for Yee (1656 cm)
and Yc}, (962 cm™') are shifted hypsochromically to higher wave-
numbers, compared to estragole (vcic at 1638 cm™ and yoy
at 912 cm™') and y-asarone (vcic at 1640 cm and 7eq at
912 cm).

For the two isolated double bonds in limonene the cor-
responding signals are veic at 1679 and 1644 cm™! as well as
You at 914 and 886 cm”.

For the differentiation of estragole and y-asarone the wave-
number range from 1200 to 1130 cm”, showing the asym-
metric and symmetric valence vibrations Y¢_9-¢ from the
different methoxy groups, proved to be suitable.

Figure 8. Raman spectra of CCL, extracts from different fennel genotypes and the corresponding standards for the most valuable components in the

volatile fraction.

 

Despite the relatively weak IR activity of the C=C double
bonds, cluster analysis on the basis of the above-mentioned
spectral ranges results in a successful differentiation and
classification of the four considered fennel chemotypes,
even for the intact fennel fruits, the spectra of which are
dominated by matrix signals from starch, lipids, and water
(Figure 6).

Figure 7 shows the hierarchical cluster analysis of all fennel
accessions investigated in this study according to the GC-FID
data (A), compared to the ATR-FTIR spectra of the fennel
extracts (B) and the intact fruits (C), as well as the Raman
spectra of the extracts (D, discussed later).

According to the qualitative and quantitative composition of
their volatile fraction, the 10 considered fennel genotypes can
be classified into 4 chemotypes: the trans-anethole type with
accessions cv. Berfena, FOE 16, FOE 18, cv. Chumen, and cv.
Feniks; the estragole type with FOE 43 and FOE 48; the y-
asarone type with FOE 86 and FOE 87; and the piperitenone
oxide type FOE 25, shown in Figure 7A.

3544

The same classification is obtained by ATR-FTIR for both
the fruits and the extract (Figure 7B,C). The only difference is
the subgrouping of FOE 25, which is pooled together with the
estragole type and the y-asarone type in a larger cluster for ATR-
FTIR and with the trans-anethole type for GC. This might be
easily explained by the absence or very low concentration of trans-
anethole in FOE 25, the estragole type, and the y-asarone type.

Additionally, for the fruits and the extracts, a strict separa-
tion of sweet and bitter fennel, as demanded by the European
Pharmacopoeia, can be observed between the cluster of the
trans-anethole chemotype. The two accessions, cv. Berfena and
FOE 16, contain much more than 15% of fenchone and
simultaneously a content of trans-anethole of about 60%. In
contrast, cv. Chumen, cv. Feniks, and FOE 18 show a fenchone
content between 6 and 10% going along with concentrations of
trans-anethole of 73% and higher. The slightly lower values for
trans-anethole, as demanded by the European Pharmacopoeia,
is a consequence of the solvent extraction used in this work
instead of water steam distillation.

Hence, the ATR-FTIR technique offers for both the extracts
and the intact fruits a fast tool for the discrimination of different
fennel chemotypes according to the chemical profile of their
volatile fraction and additionally allows a fast differentiation
of sweet and bitter fennel within one chemotype, the trans-
anethole type.

Raman Spectroscopy. The principle of Raman spectroscopy
is the changing polarizability of a bond through the absorption
of light. Therefore, structures with unsaturated carbon bonds,
especially when conjugated, are highly Raman active.

Because the most significant differences in the structure
of the essential oil components are the number and connec-
tivity of C=C double bonds, one can expect an unambiguous
classification of the fennel accessions by Raman spectroscopy.
Figure 8 presents the Raman spectra of fennel extracts from five
representative genotypes in the fingerprint region from 1800 to
550 cm! compared to the corresponding standards of the main
components in the volatile fraction.

As already mentioned for ATR-FTIR, the main differences in
the spectra are due to the vibrations of the C=C double bond
in the side chain. The conjugation of this bond with the
aromatic ring system in trans-anethole results in a hypsochro-
mic shift of yeic to 1658 cm compared to estragole with
its isolated C=C and vec at 1638 cm. Limonene is
determined by its yoy at 760 em™'. According to previous work,
the vibration at 597 cm‘ was set as a marker band for fenchone

3545

because no other main component shows any significant signal
at this spectral range.°

On the basis of these marker bands hierarchical cluster
analysis was performed resulting in a classification of the fennel
extracts according to their chemotype as shown in Figure 7D.

According to the results from ATR-FTIR, the same grouping
of the fennel genotypes according to their main components in
the volatile fraction is obtained. The first criterion for the
clustering (cluster distance around 3.5) is the nature of the
C=C double bond in the side chain resulting in one cluster
containing the trans-anethole type (conjugated C=C, vee to
1658 cm’) and one containing the estragole type, y-asarone
type, and piperitenone oxide type (isolated C=C in estragole,
y-asarone, and limonene).

The next classification at a cluster distance of 0.5 separates
the estragole type from the y-asarone type and the piperitenone
oxide type due to the contents of fenchone (597 cm™'). The
same attribute separates the “sweet” fennel from the “bitter”
fennel in the cluster of the trans-anethole- type (cluster distance
around 0.2). Finally, discrimination between FOE 25 and FOE
86/FOE 87, the piperitenone oxide type, and y-asarone type
results on the basis of the limonene content and its marker
band 7¥¢y, at 760 cm™.

In conclusion, the results obtained in this study show that
Raman spectroscopy allows a fast and precise discrimination
of different fennel chemotypes according to their chemical

dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf405752x | J. Agric. Food Chem. 2014, 62, 3537-3547

composition even on the level of a single spectrum. As already
presented for ATR-FTIR, Raman spectroscopy is also a suitable
tool to distinguish between sweet and bitter fennel without
application of time-consuming chromatography.

NIR Spectroscopy. NIRS has been established for years as a
fast and nondestructive method for qualitative and quantitative
evaluation of numerous primary and secondary metabolites
directly in plant material.!274-?6

A few years ago our group already developed a reliable quan-
tification protocol for the determination of valuable essential oil
components directly in intact fennel fruits, presenting NIRS as
a promising tool for the chemotaxonomical characterization
of the considered fennel chemotypes.'® According to former
studies performed on basil, oregano, and thyme, the NIR
spectra of the analyzed fennel fruits are dominated by overtones
or different combinations of C—H stretching and bending
vibrations occurring between 4000 and 9000 cm™!, As shown in
Figure 9, the NIR spectra of the fruits obviously show no
significant differences.

As the essential oil composition structurally differs only in
comparatively narrow ranges, the similarity of the NIR spectra
is evident. Nevertheless, even those small variations can be
sufficient for a successful interpretation by applying chemo-
metric algorithms.

Figure 10 presents a cluster analysis based on NIR spectral
data resulting in a strict separation of all four fennel chemotypes

in the same manner as described for Raman and ATR-FTIR
spectroscopy. The considered spectral ranges are restricted to
combination vibrations and the first and second overtones of
C-H and C-C (4100-4650, 6000-6250, and 8200-9000 em),
Only the discrimination of sweet and bitter fennel is not sufficiently
obtained when this NIRS method is applied.

Nevertheless, NIRS offers a fast and easy way to distinguish
different fennel chemotypes on the base of their main essential
oil components directly in intact fruits. An indirect discrim-
ination of sweet and bitter fennel can be obtained by the
verified prediction of the trans-anethole and fenchone contents
by NIRS, published by Steuer and Schulz.’® Furthermore, the

special advantage of NIRS measurements over mid-IR or

3546

Raman spectroscopy is that analyzed samples are more repre-
sentative with regard to their sample presentation technique
and sample quantity (approximately 0.5 g of the fennel fruits is
put into glass cuvettes, resulting in a “sample layer” of about
15 mm thickness with a penetration depth of the NIR beam of
several millimeters). This guarantees improved sample
homogeneity compared to the two other vibrational spectros-
copy techniques.
