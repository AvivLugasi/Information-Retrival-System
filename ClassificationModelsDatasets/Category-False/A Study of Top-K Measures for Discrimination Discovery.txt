ABSTRACT

Data mining approaches for discrimination discovery unveil
contexts of possible discrimination against protected-by-law
groups by extracting classification rules from a dataset of
historical decision records. Rules are ranked according to
some legally-grounded contrast measure defined over a 4-
fold contingency table, including risk difference, risk ratio,
odds ratio, and a few others. Due to time and cost con-
straints, however, only the top-& ranked rules are taken into
further consideration by an anti-discrimination analyst. In
this paper, we study to what extent the sets of top-& ranked
rules with respect to any two pairs of measures agree.

1. INTRODUCTION

Human right laws [1, 10, 11] prohibit discrimination against
protected groups on the grounds of race, color, religion, na-
tionality, sex, gender, marital status, age and pregnancy;
and in a number of settings, including credit and insurance;
sale, rental, and financing of housing; personnel selection
and wages; access to public accommodations, education,
nursing homes, adoptions, and health care. Recently, the
issue of discrimination analysis has been considered from
a data mining perspective [5, 6]. Discrimination discovery
from data consists in the actual discovery of discriminatory
situations and practices hidden in a large amount of histor-
ical decision records. The aim is to unveil contexts of possi-
ble discrimination on the basis of legally-grounded measures

of the degree of discrimination suffered by protected-by-law
groups in such contexts. Reasoning on the extracted con-
texts can support all the actors in an argument about pos-
sible discriminatory behaviors. A complainant in a case can
use them to find specific situations in which there is a prima
facie evidence of discrimination against groups she belongs
to. A decision maker can use them to prevent incurring
in discriminatory decisions. Finally, control authorities can
base the fight against discrimination on a formalized process
of intelligent data analysis.

However, the actual discovery of discriminatory situations
and practices may reveal an extremely difficult task. The
reason is twofold. First, a huge number of possible con-
texts may, or may not, be the theater for discrimination. To
see this point, consider the case of gender discrimination in
credit approval: although an analyst may observe that no
discrimination occurs in general, i.e., when considering the
whole available decision records, it may turn out that it is ex-
tremely difficult for aged women to obtain car loans. Many
small or large niches may exist that conceal discrimination,
and therefore all possible specific situations should be con-
sidered as candidates, consisting of all possible combinations
of variables and variable values: personal data, demograph-
ics, social, economic and cultural indicators, etc. Second,
the interpretation of existing legislations lead to different
quantitative measures of discrimination and, a fortiori, to
different rankings of the possibly discriminatory contexts to
be considered by an anti-discrimination analyst.

The first problem, i.e., extracting contexts of possible dis-
crimination, has been considered in [5, 6] by resorting to the
extraction of classification rules maximizing some discrim-
ination measure defined over the 4-fold contingency table
of the rule. In this paper, we focus on the second problem
by studying how the rankings induced by different discrim-
ination measures affect the results of the analysis. Due to
time and cost constraints, an anti-discrimination analyst can
afford to (manually) investigate a limited number of possi-
ble contexts/rules, hence typically she will extract the top-k
rules with respect to a given discrimination measure. We
intend to investigate whether such a set of rules differs sig-
nificantly from one measure to another, or, if their rankings
differs significantly.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we sur-
vey the various discrimination measures and recall the ap-
proach based on classification rule extraction and ranking.
In Sect. 3-5, we study the distributions of values of pairs
of measures on a reference dataset of credit applications.
Finally, Sect. 6 summarizes the contributions of the paper.

2. BACKGROUND

Discrimination Measures. Consider a dataset of his-
torical decisions about granting or not a benefit (e.g., a loan,
a job, a wage increase, a school admission). A common tool
for statistical analysis is provided by a 2 x 2, or 4-fold, con-
tingency table, as shown in Fig. 1. Different outcomes be-
tween two groups are measured in terms of the proportion
of people in each group with a specific outcome. Consider a
subset of the decisions, which we call a context. The propor-
tions of benefit denied for the protected-by-law group (p1),
the unprotected-by-law group (pz) and the overall subset (p)
are considered. A general principle is then to consider group
under-representation in obtaining a benefit as a quantita-
tive measure of discrimination against a protected-by-law
(briefly, protected) group.

Group under-representation can be measured as differ-
ences and rates of these proportions, including:

e risk difference (RD = pi — p2), also known as absolute
risk reduction,

e risk ratio or relative risk (RR = pi/p2),

relative chance (RC = (1 — p1)/(1 — p2)), also known
as selection rate,

odds ratio (OR = pi(1 — p2)/(pe(1 — pi))),

and the versions of RD, RR, and RC when the protected
group is compared to the average proportion p, rather than
to the proportion of the unprotected group: extended dif-
ference (ED = pi — p); extended ratio or extended lift (ER.
=p./p); extended chance (EC = (1 — p1)/(1 —p)).

Level curves of RD, RR, RC, and OR over the 2-D risk
plane [3] are shown in Fig. 2. The degree of observed dis-
proportionate burden over the protected group is monotonic
increasing for RD, RR, and OR (resp., ED, and ER), and
monotonic decreasing for RC (resp., ED). Since one is in-
terested in contexts of higher benefit denial (resp., lower
benefit granting) for the protected group compared to the
unprotected group or to the average, the values of interest
for RR, OR, and ER are those greater than 1; for RD and
ED are those greater than 0; and for RC and EC are those
lower than 1. [5] showed that RR > 1 iff OR > 1 iff ER > 1.
It is readily checked that this is the case also iff RD > 0 iff
ED > 0 iff RC < 1 iff EC < 1. Summarizing, all the mea-
sures agree on the contexts to be considered as potentially

discriminatory. Our objective is to study whether this holds
also when restricting to the top-& contexts.

From a legal point of view, several measures are adopted
worldwide. UK law [9](a) mentions risk difference, EU Court
of Justice has given more emphasis on the risk ratio (see
[8, Section 3.5]), and US laws and courts mainly refer to
the selection rate. Notice that the risk ratio is the ratio
of the proportions of benefit denial between the protected
and unprotected groups, while selection rate is the ratio of
the proportions of benefit granting. Also, the odds ratio has
been widely considered in legal research studies.

Discrimination Discovery by Rule Mining. The
legal principle of under-representation has inspired exist-
ing approaches for discrimination discovery based on pat-
tern mining. Starting from a dataset of historical deci-
sion records, [5, 6] propose to extract classification rules of
the form A,B —- C, called potentially discriminatory (PD)
rules, to unveil contexts B of the dataset where the protected
group A suffered from under-representation with respect to
the decision C. A is a non-empty itemset, whose elements
denote a fixed set of protected groups. C is a class item
denoting the negative decision, e.g., credit denying, applica-
tion rejection, job firing, and so on. Finally, B is an itemset
denoting a context of possible discrimination. The degree of
under-representation is measured by a measure from Fig. 1,
where the contingency table refers to only those records sat-
isfying B. As an example, RACE=BLACK, PURPOSE=NEW_CAR
— CREDIT=No is a PD rule about denying credit (the de-
cision C) to blacks (the protected group A) among those
applying for the purpose of buying a new car (the context
B). PD rules are ranked by their value of the discrimination
measure. The approach has been implemented in [7].

The German Credit Dataset. As a running exam-
ple of our study, we consider the public domain German
credit dataset [4], which consists of 1000 records over bank
account holders. It includes attributes on personal proper-
ties, past/current credits, employment status, and on per-
sonal status. The decision attribute represents the good/bad
creditor decision assigned to the bank account holder. The
protected groups considered in the analyses include female
non-single, foreign workers, and senior people. When not
otherwise specified, classification rules are extracted with a
minimum support of 2%.

tion rules extracted from the German credit dataset,

M2 value included in the top-& rules w.r.t. M1.

3. MEASURES OVER p, AND P;

Let us start by comparing the measures defined over pro-
portions pi and pz, namely RR, OR, RD, and RC.

RR vs OR. Fig. 3 (left) shows the 2-D risk plane for the
top-é classification rules, with & = 1000, extracted from the
German credit dataset and ranked w.r.t. RR and OR. More
in detail, in such a plot (and in the other similar 2-D plots)
we show:

e as red points those rules (denoted as RRM OR) be-
longing to the top-& set of both measures;

e as green points those rules (denoted as RR \ OR) be-
longing to the top-k set of RR only;

e as blue points those rules (denoted as OR \ RR) be-
longing to the top-k set of OR only;

e the level curve corresponding to the RR of the k*”
ranked rule (in the plot, RR = 2.10), ie., such that all
top-k rules w.r.t. RR lie below it;

e the level curve corresponding to the OR of the k*”
ranked rule (in the plot, OR = 2.87), ie., such that all
top-k rules w.r.t. OR. lie below it.

OR has been often regarded as a good approximation of RR,
due to the fact that for p; = 0, it turns out 1 — p; = 1, and
1 — p2 © 1 (since we assume p; > p2), which in turn imply
RC 1, and then OR = RR/RC = RR.

In Fig. 3 (left), it is readily checked that for p; < 0.4,
the level curve of OR is very close to the one of RR. In
other terms, the top-& rules w.r.t. RR missed by the top-k
tules w.r.t. OR (ie., the green points in the plot) lie very
close to the lowest ranked rule w.r.t RR. Hence, the most
relevant rules w.r.t. RR are not missed by looking at the

128

most relevant rules w.r.t. OR. The highest RR value of a
missed rule is 2.477, which is close to the RR = 2.10 of the
k* yanked rule and well below to the RR = 9.515 of the
1** ranked rule. However, the blue points in Fig. 3 (left)
highlight a number of rules in the top-k set w.r.t. OR that
do not belong to the top-k set w.r.t. RR. Those rules are
ranked as interesting w.r.t. OR. but they are not w.r.t. RR.
As an example, the top-k set w.r.t. OR contains a rule with
a RR of only 1.52.

Table 1 details these statistics for all pairs of measures.
It answers the question: “How interesting M2 values are
missed and how irrelevant M2 values are considered when
using a measure M1 in place of M2?”. If missed and included
values are close to the k*” ranked M2 value, then M1 can be
considered a good proxy for M2, covering all its top-ranked
rules while not covering low-ranked ones.

Finally, it is worth noting that, in general, the level curves
of RR. vs OR have the form as in Fig. 3 (left). In fact,
the level curve of RR is pi/v, for v being the RR of the
k* yanked rule w.r.t. RR, and the level curve of OR is
pi/(pitv'(1—p1)), for v’ being the RR of the k*” ranked rule
w.r.t. OR. By basic algebra, they intersect only at p; = 0
and at pi = (v’ — v)/(v’ - 1).

RR vs RD, RC. Since the level curves of RR and RD
(resp., RC) are straight lines, they intersect in one point
only, as shown in Fig. 3 (center) (resp., right). The number
of rules belonging to the top-k set of only RR or of only RD
(resp., RC) is now considerably higher.

Approximating RR. by means of RD (resp., RC) in top-k
rule extraction leads to miss the green points, with a theo-
retically upper unbounded RR. In our example, a rule with
RR = 6.262 (resp., RR = 7.765) would be missed. Also,
rules with RR much lower than the &*” ranked rule would
be considered. In our example, again, a rule with RR = 1.4
(resp., RR. = 1.24) would be considered.

Consider now approximating RD (resp., RC) by means of
RR. The rules missed by RR. (the blue points) have a RD as
high as 0.364 (resp., RC as low as 0.429). Conversely, the
rules considered by RR, but not by RD (resp., RC), have a
minimum RD of 0.099 (resp., RC of 0.892).

OR vs RD vs RC. Fig. 4 shows the 2-D plots for OR,
RD, and RC. Curves of OR and RD intersect in two points’,
while curves of OR and RC and of RD and RC intersect in
one point only. The number of rules belonging to the top-&
set of only OR (resp., RD) or of only RD (resp., RC) appears
moderate, in the same order as in the case RR vs OR. We
refer the reader to Table 1 for details of using one of the
three measures as an approximation for another.

Intersection and Order Correlation. Starting from
the sample & = 1000 considered so far, it is now legitimate
to ask ourselves how many rules are shared, for generic k’s,
between the top-& sets of any two measures. The answer
also solves the question of how many rules in one of the two
top-& sets belong to it only, namely & minus the number of
rules that belong to both. Intuitively, for increasing k, the
top-& sets tend to converge to the set of all rules. We expect
then that the fraction of shared rules is a monotonically in-
creasing function over k. This is confirmed in Fig. 5 (left,
center). RD vs RC and RR vs OR. show the largest. over-

lhe intersection points occur at the solutions of a quadratic equation
in p1 obtained by equating the level curve of OR (p2 = pi/(pitv(1—
pi)), for v being the OR of the k*” ranked rule w.r.t. OR) and RD
(po = pi —v’, for v’ being the RD of the k*® ranked rule w.r.t. OR).

lapping set of rules. RR vs RC has the smallest overlapping
set. This is rather relevant from a practical (legal) point
of view: EU laws (RR) and US laws (RC) do not lead the
anti-discrimination analyst to reason on a significantly over-
lapping set of potentially discriminatory classification rules.

Another intuitive question is whether the rankings of two
measures are correlated on the set of overlapping rules, i.e.,
whether the two measures impose the same order on the
rules shared by their top-& sets. Kendall’s correlation co-
efficient 7 represents the difference between the probability
that in the observed data two variables are in the same order
versus the probability that the two variables are in different
orders. It ranges from -1 (negative correlation, i.e., inverse
ordering) to +1 (positive correlation, i.e., same ordering).
Fig. 5 (right) shows the Kendall’s 7 by varying k for three
pairs of measures, the top two and the bottom one with re-
spect to the overlapping fraction. Unfortunately, 7 appears
to be rather unstable, apart for RR vs OR. for which it is
almost over 0.5. Since the top-é rules are only a prima facie
evidence of discrimination, they are (manually) screened by
the anti-discrimination analyst to validate their legal rele-
vance. The negative conclusion from Fig. 5 (right) is that,
using a discrimination measure to rank the rules to be val-
idated does not help in covering earlier the most relevant
rules with respect to a different measure.

4. MEASURES OVER Pp, AND P

We turn now the attention on measures defined over pro-
portions p; and p, namely ER, ED, and EC. The 2-D risk
planes in Fig. 6 are defined over p; as the x-axis, and p as
the y-axis. Compared to their respective (i.e., RD for ED,
RR for ER, and RC for EC) plots from Fig. 3 and Fig. 5, it
is readily checked that the points:

e are more flattened around the level curve of the k’”-
ranked rule. This is explained by a smaller variability
range of the measures, as shown in Table 1. As an
example, ER. ranges from 1.808 to 1.234, whilst RR
ranges from 9.515 to 2.1;

are more centered in the 2-D risk plane. Since, in
general, p > min{p1, po}, any rule plotted in the p;-p2
risk plane would be plotted on a higher (if pi > po,
otherwise in a lower) y-point in the pi-p risk plane.

The fraction of overlapping rules between any pair of the
ER, ED, and EC measures appears considerably high. This
is confirmed in Fig. 7 (left), showing that ED and EC almost
yield the same top-& set of rules, even for reasonably low k.
Table 1 also shows that the rules missed by ED (resp., EC)
would not rank high w.r.t. EC (resp., ED). Nevertheless,
we should not draw a general conclusion. So far, we have
considered classification rules with a minimum support of
2%. The assumption of extracting rules with a minimum
support threshold is natural in discrimination analysis: it
amounts at extracting contexts where a minimum number
of persons of the protected group are treated unfavourably.
Do the trends of Fig. 5 (left, center) and Fig. 7 (left) hold in
general? Unfortunately, this is not the case. For lower min-
imum support thresholds, the fraction of overlapping rules
tends to decrease rapidly, as shown in Fig. 7 (center) for
EDN EC. As an example, for a 0.5% minimum support,
to reach an overlapping fraction of 50%, we must consider
at least 500 rules. Intuitively, this fact can be explained by
the exponential growth of the number of classification rules
extracted, and, a fortiori, of the number of possible contexts
where the ED and EC rankings significantly differ.

Finally, Fig. 7 (right) shows that a similar trend occurs
for the adult dataset [4] as well. Strictly speaking, adult is

w.r.t. RR (for k = 1000, v = 2.1), and v’ be the ER value
for the k**-ranked rule w.r.t. ER (for k = 1000, v’ = 1.234). 6. CONCLUSIONS

A rule belongs to the top-k set of only RR iff pi/p2 > v Classification rules have been adopted for discrimination
and pi/p < vu’. By elementary algebra, this occurs only if discovery by interpreting legal measures of under-representa-
p/p. > v/v’ (in our example, v/v’ = 2.1/1.234 = 1.702). tion as interestingness measures over a 4-fold contingency
Similarly, a rule belongs to the top-k set of only ER only if table. Extracted classification rules are ranked according to

a measure, and only the top-é rules are taken into (manual)
consideration by the anti-discrimination analyst for further
investigation. However, which measure has to be consid-
ered is not always known in advance, e.g., as in a legal case
before a court. This gives raise to the problem of under-
standing at which extent any two measures yield the same
set of top-& rules. We studied such a problem on a reference
dataset of credit applications, with some theoretical analy-
ses applicable in general. We can summarize the following
specific conclusions of this study: (1) among all the pairs of
measures, RR and OR, RD and RC, and ED and EC, show
the largest overlapping set of top-& rules; (2) among all
pairs of measures, RR (mainly adopted in the US legal sys-
tem) and RC (mainly adopted in the EU legal system) have
the smallest overlapping set of top-& rules; (3) in all cases,
however, the set of overlapping rules rapidly degrades as the
minimum support threshold of the extracted rules decreases;
(4) for none of the pairs of measures there is a stable and
relevant correlation between the rankings imposed by the
two measures over the set of overlapping rules; (5) pairs of
measures that differ only in the comparator proportion (RR
vs ER, RD vs ED, RC vs EC) lead to top-k sets with a small
percentage of overlapping rules. We believe that the above
conclusions represent a relevant contribution of data mining
to the legal debate on anti-discrimination, consisting in ana-
lytical means to support the choice, e.g., at legislative level,
of a quantitative measure of the qualitative legal principle
of under-representation.
