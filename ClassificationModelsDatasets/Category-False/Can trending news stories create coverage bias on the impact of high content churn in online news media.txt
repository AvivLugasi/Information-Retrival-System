Can Trending News Stories Create Coverage Bias?
On the Impact of High Content Churn in Online News Media

Online news media sites are presently the primary sources
of news for a large number of users world-wide. The content published by media sites have high temporal churn
as they tend to focus on recommending recent / breaking
news. Analyzing data from a popular online mass media
site nytimes.com as well as a popular online social media
site twitter.com, we show that the resulting churn in popular content can lead to temporal coverage biases in the
stories that are consumed by a user, based on the time of
the day when the user accesses the media sites.

INTRODUCTION

Online news media sites, be they mass media sites like New
York Times (nytimes.com) or CNN (cnn.com) or social media sites like Facebook or Twitter, are emerging as the primary (and frequently only) sources of news for a large and
rapidly growing fraction of people world-wide. The number
of users receiving news via traditional offline methods, e.g.,
via print newspapers and weeklies, are in steep decline [14].
A recent survey by the Pew Research Center [5] found that
around 48% of American Internet users got politics news on
social media sites like Facebook, almost as many as those
that got such news from local television channels.
Due to the round-the-clock (24/7) nature of online news
and the need to keep their audience coming back to their
site1 , online news sites today are emphasizing recent news
stories over relevant or important news stories. A user visiting the sites is often recommended news stories that became popular only recently, often within the last hour. Social media sites like Facebook and Twitter update “Trending Topics” every 10 to 15 minutes, while mass media sites
like nytimes.com update the “Top Stories” displayed prominently at the top of their home pages constantly throughout
the day. Such constant churn in top recommended content
incentivizes users to visit the sites repeatedly and helps disseminate breaking news stories rapidly. However, excessive
emphasis on recency in online news media risks overloading users with unnecessary information [11] and raises the
common refrain why is this news? [17].
In this paper, we investigate a previously overlooked concern with the constant churn in popular content published by
online media sites. Specifically, when users browse the media
sites at different times of the day, they might receive very

Niloy Ganguly*

Similar to most online websites, many online news media
sites are also predominantly funded by their users watching
advertisements on their sites.

different top news stories. A user who habitually browses
nytimes.com at 9 AM every day might see a very different
topical coverage of news-stories, as compared to another user
who browses the site at 9 PM every day. For instance, the
breaking stories at 9 AM might be predominantly covering
Business / Finance news, while the breaking stories at 9
PM might be largely covering Sports news. A recent survey
by the American Press Institute [1] found that a majority
63% of users prefer to read news at some specific point of
time in a day - either in the morning, in the evening, in the
afternoon or right before bed.
Over extended periods of time, such differences in the
browsing pattens of individual users might lead to substantial biases in topical coverage of news stories consumed by
individual users. Using the terminology introduced in [8],
we refer to the distribution of topics (e.g., Sports, Business)
of news stories consumed by a user as the user’s information
diet. So the central question we investigate in this paper is:
Do temporal recommendations in online news media lead to
biased topical coverage in their users’ information diets?
To address the above question, we analyze extensive data
gathered from two popular online news media sites: (i) Twitter, a social media site, and (ii) New York Times (nytimes.com), a mass media site. Our analysis reveals high
churn in top recommended content in both sites. We also
find considerable diurnal variation in coverage of news stories related to specific topics. For example, news stories
related to Economy or Science are recommended predominantly at certain times of the day and not at other times.
We further show that such churn in top news stories can
induce a significant bias in the topical coverage of a user’s
diet, depending on the diurnal browsing pattern of the user.
In summary, our study highlights the potential for coverage bias in today’s online news media sites. Through this
paper, we seek to raise awareness about the problem and
call on the research and news media community to explore
practical solutions to the problem.

2. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
Coverage Bias of News Media: Several works in media
studies [3, 7] analyzing the news articles on the issues like
political bias, fairness and accuracy of the presented facts.
Moreover, several media watchdog groups like FAIR (fair.
org) monitor the news media organisations for any bias or
misinformation introduced in their stories. However, in this
paper, we show how temporal recommendation introduces
unintended bias in the content stream – which otherwise
goes unnoticed if analyzed on individual stories.

Recency vs. Relevancy Debate: Present approaches
on designing content recommendation systems are putting
increasing emphasis on the recency and realtimeness of content. For example, [9] presents the design of a time-aware
content recommendation system. [10] proposes a framework
to detect breaking news, trending events from online social
media in realtime. Due to this focus on recency, content
recommendation systems are considering more temporal parameters to rank documents. As a result, there is a growing
concern over the relevance (or long-term importance) of the
content recommended by such systems and many users view
such recommended contents as potentially waste-of-time information [11, 15]. Although this debate on recency versus
relevance is going on for some time, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to point out that the media systems’
emphasis on recency are creating a filtering effect on users,
who are potentially missing out on certain types of information depending on their browsing habits.
Diurnal patterns in user browsing behavior: In this
paper, we argue that browsing patterns of users impacts
their consumption of news. Intuitively, we would expect
different users around the world (in different timezones) to
access media websites at different times of the day. Prior
studies have observed strong diurnal patterns in accessing
messages and applications on Facebook [6], and in the content generation of blog posts, bookmarks, as well as answers
in Q&A websites [4]. A study by Benevenuto et al. [2] analyzed browsing patterns of tens of thousands of users, using click-stream data from a social network aggregator site.
They observed that most of the users accessed the sites only
a few times and during certain periods of a day.
Personalization and Filter Bubbles: Researchers have
investigated the issue of ‘Filter Bubbles’ arising out of personalized content recommendation to suit user interests [13].
According to [13], as users get recommendations based on
their profiles (locations, past click behaviors, search histories), they gradually become separated from the type of information that diverts from their past behavior and eventually get isolated in their own cultural or ideological bubbles.
Interestingly, in our study, we show that filtering effects can arise even in the absence of personalization. All
the content recommendation systems we investigate in this
work broadcast the same recommended contents to all users;
therefore, there is no personalization involved. Rather the
filtering effects arise inadvertently due to the complex correlations between user browsing times and high churn in the
popular content recommendations.

COVERAGE BIAS IN USER DIETS

As stated in Section 1, we want to investigate whether temporal recommendations in online news media sites lead to
biased topical coverage in the users’ information diets. We
attempt to address this question in the context of two content recommendation systems deployed in two popular online news media – (i) ‘Trending Topics’ in the online social
media site Twitter (www.twitter.com), and (ii) ‘Top Stories’
in the online mass media site New York Times (henceforth
referred to as NYTimes) (www.nytimes.com).

3.1 Datasets Gathered
Twitter Trending Topics: Twitter periodically publishes
10 trending topics (‘trends’ in short) to help its users find

Figure 1: Snapshot of the NYTimes homepage. The ‘Top
Stories’ section is highlighted in bluish grey.

the currently most popular topics of discussion in Twitter.
According to the official Twitter blog [12], trends are the
keywords whose usage at a certain time instant dramatically increases compared to its earlier usage. Twitter users
can specifically choose to receive either worldwide trends
or trends specific to a particular geographical region. We
collected US trends using the Twitter API2 at 15-minute
intervals, during January – July, 2014 (7 months). Overall,
we collected 21, 180 distinct trends during this period.
NYTimes Top Stories: To enable the users to take a
quick look at the most important news-stories at a particular time, NYTimes provides around 20 articles in the ‘Top
Stories’ section in the website. As shown in the Figure 1,
this section consumes a very prominent screen space in the
NYTimes home page. Hence, it can be safely assumed that
most visitors of NYTimes read the articles listed in the ‘Top
Stories’ section. Using the NYTimes developer API3 , we
collected the top stories at 5-minute intervals, over 40 days
during April – May, 2015. Overall, we collected 3, 050 distinct top stories.

3.2 Users’ News Consumption Habits
We begin by studying news consumption habits of users.
A recent survey by the American Press Institute [1] found
that while 33% of users consumed news throughput the day
(hence, differences in the topical composition of news-stories
is less likely to affect them), a majority 63% of the users
prefer to read news only during a specific period of a day –
either in the morning, or in the afternoon, or in the evening,
or right before bed. These users can be exposed to different
topical coverages if the composition of news at these times
are different.
We further probed users’ reading habits on the NYTimes
site. There is no easy way of knowing which news-stories a
user has read on the site, hence we considered the posting
of a comment on a news-article by a user as a proxy for his
reading the article. Overall, we collected 885,421 comments
posted by 133,189 distinct users during April to August,
2015, and analyzed the commenting behavior of the users.
We divided the users into four groups based on their commenting frequencies, as shown in Table 1. It can be seen
that more than 90% of the users – labelled as the incidental
and occasional news consumers – commented only during
one or two hours of a day on average. We also looked into

the specific hours at which they post the comments, and
found that most of these users post comments only during
1–3 specific hours of a day. We also noticed another interesting aspect – out of all the news-stories on which users
commented, around 75% were top stories, and this fraction
is similar across all groups.
Thus, both our observations and those by the American
Press Institute [1] indicate that a large majority of users are
incidental / occasional news consumers who access news media only during one or two specific hours of a day, and read
mostly the top news-stories. Hence, the problem we study –
differences in the topical composition of top news-stories at
different hours of a day – is very likely to affect these users
(though, it might not affect the few news addicts).

3.3 Churn-Rate of Trending News Stories
Our analysis above shows that a majority of users visit media
sites only once or twice in a day. The next step is to understand the rate at which the popularity of content is changing
within such systems. If the popular content is fairly static,
the churn-rate (i.e., the rate at which the set of trending
news-stories is changing) will be very low. As a result, users
will receive similar information regardless of the time they
are visiting the media site. However, if the churn-rate is
high, then the users visiting the site at different times of the
day will consume very different sets of content.
To compute the churn-rate in a news media (Twitter
or NYTimes), we measure the average fraction of nonoverlapping stories between every pair of trending stories’
sets separated by time t in our dataset, where t varies from
15 minutes to 24 hours. Figure 2 shows the churn in both
Twitter Trends and NYTimes Top Stories.
For Twitter, on an average, around 45% of the trends
change within a gap of only 15 minutes. If we compare two
sets of trends at a time difference of 2 hours, the average
churn is around 75%. With larger time difference, the churn
increases further and remains above 90%.
The churn rate of NYTimes Top Stories is less than the

churn rate of Twitter trends; however, as much as 70% of the
top stories gets replaced within a six-hour time difference.
These results clearly show that the online media systems’
emphasis on ‘recency’ has made the systems so dynamic that
all the content have very fleeting priority – even the set of
top (most popular) content in these systems is not remaining the same for more than 1 − 2 hours. As a result, two
users visiting the media sites at only 6 hours time differences, would receive 70% − 85% different sets of popular
contents. Therefore, the timing at which a particular user
is visiting the media becomes immensely important and affects the composition of information received by the user. In
the next section, we show how we can use the notion of ‘information diet’ to characterize the difference in information
consumption by the users.

3.4 Temporal Bias in Topical News Coverage
To understand the temporal bias within a particular topic,
we need to infer topics of the trending news-stories in Twitter and NYTimes respectively - the methodology of which
is elaborated next.

3.4.1 Inferring topics for trending news stories
Inferring the topics of Twitter trends is challenging due to
the limited information contained in very short tweets (at
most 140 characters) as well as the frequent use of informal
language. Several prior studies have attempted to infer topics for trends / keywords in Twitter [8, 16]. In this paper,
we use the topic inference methodology recently developed
in [8], which infers the topic of a given keyword from the
topical expertise of the authors of the tweets containing the
keyword. The basic intuition is that if a certain keyword is
being posted by many users who are interested in (or experts
on) a common topic, then the keyword is very likely to be
relevant to the topic. Table 2 (1st row) shows the different
topics that are inferred by this methodology for any given
trend.
For NYTimes articles, the authors (or editors) assign a
particular section (or a subsection) to each article. We consider this section / subsection of an article as its topic. Table 2 (2nd row) lists all major topic categories for NYTimes
top stories.

3.4.2 Diurnal variation in topical news coverage
We first check for any temporal bias in the coverage of newsstories on different topics. For this, we consider all newsstories on a particular topic, and compute how these news-

Figure 4: Coverage distribution for topics on NYTimes Top Stories

stories are recommended at different hours of a day. This
distribution will be nearly uniform for a topic if that particular topic gets uniform coverage throughout the day.
Figure 3 and Figure 4 show the hourly distribution for different topics, respectively for Twitter trends and NYTimes
top stories. We see that, except a few topics which are covered adequately throughout the day (like ‘Sports’ in Twitter
trends and ‘Politics’ or ‘N.Y./Region’ in NYTimes), there
are huge diurnal variations for most of the topics.
Specially for niche topics like ‘Education’ in NYTimes
(Figure 4(b)), there are several time periods in a day where
there is no article on the topic among the top stories. As a
result, if some user is interested in a niche topic, she needs
to browse the top stories at certain hours to have a higher
chance of getting stories on her topic of interest. Similarly,
if a user is browsing the site at specific hours everyday, she
might be missing the niche topics which do not get recommended at these hours.

3.5 Topical Coverage Bias in User Diets
As different topics get non-uniform diurnal coverage, the
pertinent question to ask is how users’ overall information
consumption are getting affected by the diurnal variations
in coverage. We use the notion of ‘information diet’ [8] to
address this question. A user’s information diet is computed
as the topical composition of all content consumed by her.
Therefore, if a large fraction of the news-stories consumed
by a user is related to a certain topic, her information diet
will become biased towards that topic.
To characterize the topical coverage bias, we consider dif-

ferent users who browse the media sites regularly during different hours of a day, e.g., a user who browses a site between
9 A.M. and 10 A.M. every day. We assume for simplicity
that a user browsing a media system at a particular hour will
read all the content recommended (as top stories, or trending
topics) during that one-hour period. Figure 5 and Figure 6
show how different users visiting Twitter and NYTimes at
different times will cover different topics in different proportions, and hence have different information diets. The hours
shown in the figures are chosen to represent the most likely
hours for users to visit media sites according to the American Press Institute Survey [1]. Since a particular topic’s
contribution to the information diet is different at different hours, users’ topical coverage will be dependent on their
browsing habits. For example, as shown in Figure 6, a user
browsing NYTimes during 5 P.M. – 7 P.M. every day will
receive more Science related news, whereas a user browsing
during 11 A.M. – 1 P.M. every day will receive more stories
from ‘The Upshot’ section.
We next investigate whether the diurnal variation in the
topical coverage affects the users’ diets more for certain topics than others. To quantify this, we compute the standard
deviation of the topics’ contributions to the hourly information diet, and then normalize the deviation by the mean
contribution value. Figure 7 and Figure 8 show the result for
the Twitter trends and NYTimes top stories. We see that
the variation in user’s diet, depending on her browsing time,
is relatively less for more popular topics (e.g., Politics-law or
Entertainment in Twitter, and Politics or U.S. in NYTimes)

since these topics get recommended uniformly throughout
the day. However, the variation is substantially higher for
the niche topics (e.g. Health-fitness or Environment in Twitter, and Travel or Food in NYTimes) than the popular ones.
Therefore, for users who are specifically interested in these
niche topics, the temporal variation in the coverage of newsstories on these topics can lead to significant imbalances in
their information diets.

CONCLUDING DISCUSSION

In this work, we showed that the topical composition of the
information consumed by a user is effected by the user’s
browsing patterns on online news media sites. This problem
- which, to our knowledge, has not been reported in any prior
work – is a result of the high temporal churn in the popular
content published by the media sites. Possible solutions to
solve this imbalance can be twofold - (i) The users will need
to devise a strategy of accessing the media sites such that
their desired information diet is maintained; however, this is
very difficult for individual users to attain. (ii) The media
systems will need to tune their published content according
to not only the popularity / recency of news-stories, but also
the user’s browsing habit and preferred information diet. In
our future work, we plan to investigate the pros and cons of
both of the above approaches.
