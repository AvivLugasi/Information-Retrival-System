Personalized stories are a powerful tool for communicating about science, particularly
when a scientific topic is complex or unfamiliar. One example of such a topic is
drought, something many regions of the world face regularly. Like other environmental
challenges, drought recovery efforts benefit from a mobilized collective response through
prosocial action, including volunteering and donations. The objective of this study was to
examine how storytelling about drought influences emotional responses and empathic
processes that in turn contribute to prosocial action. Using data collected from an
online survey (N = 249) with undergraduate students, the current study tests the
hypothesis that, relative to non-personalized stories, personalized news stories about
drought will increase audiences’ cognitive and emotional responses, including perceived
suffering, narrative engagement, and state empathy. In addition, this study examines
how emotional responses to personalized news stories influence readers’ intentions to
donate to farmers suffering from drought. Results reveal that personalized news stories
are more likely than non-personalized stories to increase readers’ state empathy and
perceptions of others’ suffering. Perceived suffering was directly related to the affective
and cognitive dimensions of state empathy. Narrative engagement (i.e., transportation)
was also directly related to the affective and cognitive dimensions of state empathy and
indirectly associated with intentions to donate to assist those suffering from drought.
Affective state empathy was directly associated with donation intentions, suggesting that
an emotional response to media portrayals of suffering may promote prosocial intentions.
We discuss the potential implications for using personalized news stories about drought
and other natural disasters to motivate prosocial action.

Personalization, Empathy, Helping, and Drought

INTRODUCTION

Wahl-Jorgensen (2013) suggests that personalized storytelling
can trigger an emotional reaction in readers that is “an
indispensable prerequisite of political action (Boltanski, 1999)”
(p. 132). Thus, when the goal of communication is to motivate
action, personalized storytelling may be key (Maier et al., 2017).
Yet to date, the links between exposure to personalized news
stories about natural hazards, the arousal of empathy, and action
to support hazard recovery or mitigation efforts are far from
clear. The present study explores audiences’ responses to both
personalized and non-personalized news stories about drought
conditions in the Western U.S. Using an online experiment (N
= 249), this study tests the hypotheses that personalization will
increase audiences’ perceptions of others’ suffering, narrative
engagement (i.e., transportation into the story), state empathy,
and ultimately, intentions to donate money to those affected by
drought. Additionally, this study seeks to identify the specific
pathways contributing to the arousal of the cognitive, affective,
and associative dimensions of empathy, and intentions to support
farmers affected by drought.

News media are a key source of public information about natural
hazards and natural disasters such as drought (Wilson, 2000;
Houston et al., 2012). Droughts, defined as prolonged periods
with rainfall below normal recorded levels1 , are associated with
reduced water supply, poor water quality, diminished crop yields,
elevated food and energy prices, wildfires, impaired riparian
habitats, and deteriorated rangeland (Mishra and Singh, 2010;
Church et al., 2020). Droughts are ubiquitous, occurring in
most countries and climatic zones (Wilhite et al., 2014). The
cumulated cost of drought in the United States make it, in
economic terms, the costliest recurring natural disaster (Cook
et al., 2007). The negative social, environmental, and economic
effects of drought are “further aggravated by growing demand for
water” and earth’s increasing mean surface temperature due to
climate change (Mishra and Singh, 2010, p. 205). The public looks
to news outlets for information about natural hazards, including
what areas are affected, the consequences of the hazard, and
community response efforts.
Until recently, environmental news has generally adhered to
the doctrine of “just-the-facts” reporting, often de-emphasizing
the role of emotions. Yet a growing number of scholars
have criticized this approach to reporting, suggesting that
emotional storytelling is a critical tool to engage audiences
and encourage public action around social and environmental
crises (Papacharissi and de Fatima Oliveira, 2012; Swim and
Bloodhart, 2015; Beckett and Deuze, 2016; Maier et al., 2017)
and large-scale distant disasters (Solman and Henderson, 2019).
Reporting about natural disasters often features people in crisis
or emotional images of people suffering (Solman and Henderson,
2019). Indeed, the emotional focus of news media’s coverage of
disasters has been described as an important tool for arousing
compassionate responses from readers, which in turn may
mobilize public engagement, volunteering, and other forms of
prosocial action (Joye, 2015).
Emotional storytelling is characterized by the frequent
use of dramatic and personalized narratives (Wahl-Jorgensen,
2013). As a form of strategic narrative, personalized narratives
focus on individual experiences, rather than collective or
group experiences (Zhou and Niederdeppe, 2017). Extensive
scholarship in health communication has documented the
persuasive effect of personalized news stories and their potential
limitations (Green, 2006; Kreuter et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2012;
Zhou and Niederdeppe, 2017). While mass media coverage of
science and biological topics regularly includes personalized
stories (Dahlstrom, 2014), little is currently known about the
implications of including personalized storytelling in news
coverage of natural hazards such as drought and water scarcity.
The potential for more frequent and severe natural hazards
associated with climate change highlights the importance of
understanding how personalized stories engage readers and may
contribute to public action during environmental crises.

THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
Narratives and Personalization
Narratives are generally defined as a story about an event or
a chain of events that occur over some time period to an
individual or group of characters (Dahlstrom, 2014). Narratives
can entertain or be strategically employed to promote social
or individual action (Zhou and Niederdeppe, 2017). Broadly,
compared to informational formats, narratives evoke a greater
emotional response, including empathic concern (Shen et al.,
2014), and help audiences identify with specific characters or
contexts (Murphy et al., 2013; Dahlstrom, 2014).
Situated within the domain of strategic narratives,
personalized stories are characterized by a focus on individual
experiences, feelings, and perspectives (Zhou and Niederdeppe,
2017). Personalization has received a great deal of attention in the
field of communication, particularly in the context of persuasive
health communication. Prior work in this area has suggested
that personalized news focused on characters’ perspectives and
feelings can promote behavior change. For example, stories
focused on individuals’ experiences produced significantly
greater positive emotions, empathic attitudes, intentions, and
behaviors toward stigmatized groups than non-narrative formats
(Oliver et al., 2012). Messages targeting respondents’ identities
were more effective than information-based messages about
organ donation, contributing to greater donor registration rates
(Dillow and Weber, 2016). Though scholarship on personalized
news about natural disasters is more limited, Maier et al. (2017)
found that the use of personalized stories about large-scale
distant suffering due to mass violence in Africa was more
effective than non-personalized news. Personalization was
also more effective than including photographs, mobilizing
information, or statistical information in generating emotional
responses similar to empathy (e.g., sympathy, sadness, anger,
compassion) and, indirectly, charitable giving (Maier et al.,
2017).

Personalization, Empathy, Helping, and Drought

Understanding how to mobilize coordinated community
response efforts is crucial considering the role that the public
can play in hazard response, recovery efforts, and political action
to encourage policies that mitigate the negative socioeconomic
impacts of drought and water scarcity. The objective of this
study is to examine the effects of personalized and nonpersonalized stories about drought to improve our understanding
of how and when personalization can motivative emotional
responses and prosocial action to support individuals suffering
from drought. To do so, we apply Zhou and Niederdeppe’s
(2017) conceptualization of personalized narratives as stories that
include (1) identifiable individuals, (2) individual experiences
(i.e., rather than collective or shared experiences), and (3) an
expression of the character’s perspectives and emotions. Below
we describe three theoretical constructs often described as
critical antecedents of narrative persuasion—empathy, perceived
suffering, and transportation. We then review theories and
previous research examining the association between empathy
and prosocial action. Finally, we the describe the results of an
online survey assessing the effect of personalization on readers’
cognitive and emotional responses, narrative engagement, and
intentions to donate to farmers suffering from drought.

Contemporary scholarship has developed interventions
focused on both the affective (Decety and Jackson, 2006)
and cognitive dimensions of state empathy, including efforts to
induce perspective taking for people with AIDS, minority groups,
and the homeless (Batson et al., 1997b; Stephan and Finlay, 1999;
Finlay and Stephan, 2000). State empathy has been measured
after exposing participants to media stimuli, such as pictures,
videos, or audio recordings of harmful acts toward people or
animals (Shelton and Rogers, 1981; Batson et al., 1997a,b, 2002;
Schultz, 2000; Berenguer, 2007; Swim and Bloodhart, 2015), or
after exposure to public service announcements (PSAs) (Stiff
et al., 1988; Bagozzi and Moore, 1994; Finlay and Stephan,
2000; Campbell and Babrow, 2004; Shen, 2010a,b, 2011; Shen
et al., 2014). Exposure to personalized narratives, including
a newspaper account of someone else’s emotional or physical
experience, has also been used to arouse empathic responses
(Stiff et al., 1988; Shen et al., 2014), though this format has
received less attention than PSAs. Drawing on this work we
posit that:
H1: Personalized news stories (vs. non-personalized
news stories) will be positively associated with readers’
state empathy.

Empathy

Media Coverage and Perceived Suffering

There is growing attention in journalism and communication
studies to the use of emotive storytelling in arousing sympathy
(Maier et al., 2017) and empathy (Shen et al., 2014). Empathy
is a multi-item contrast, that some argue differs substantially
from emotions such as sympathy and pity (Gerdes et al.,
2010). Definitions of empathy vary widely across disciplines.
Communication researchers describe empathy as being either
trait-based (e.g., an enduring characteristic of an individual)
or state-based (e.g., a reaction to empathy-arousing messages;
see Shen, 2010a). State-based empathy (or state empathy)
is a construct that describes “actual automatic and somatic
responses” (Preston and de Waal, 2002, p. 4) that are activated
after exposure to specific media stimuli (Shen, 2010a).
State empathy is a process that includes physiological and
intellectual dimensions, though scholars disagree about what
to call these dimensions (Shen, 2010a). Using Shen’s previous
framework, we define state empathy as a multi-item construct
composed of a physiological dimension (labeled as “affective”), an
intellectual dimension (labeled as “cognitive”), and an associative
dimension (called “associative”). The affective dimension of state
empathy includes the observer’s ability to physically mirror the
experiences or feelings of others (Iacoboni, 2008). Cognitive
state empathy is generally defined and measured as perspective
taking, or the act of picturing oneself in another’s shoes. The
associative dimension is a measure of character identification,
often as a result of perceived similarities between the audience
and the message subject. The role of associative state empathy has
received less attention than the other dimensions, contributing
to questions about whether identification, due to perceived
similarities between the audience and the message subject, can
reliably generate an empathic response. Thus, we add to the
existing body of literature by simultaneously evaluating the effect
of personalized news stories on the cognitive, affective, and
associative dimensions of state empathy.

Most people experience natural disasters through media coverage
(Maier et al., 2017). Therefore, how the story is framed and the
frequency of the media coverage can influence public perceptions
of natural hazards. Indeed, frequent local-level newspaper
coverage of drought conditions in California was significantly
associated with greater public concerns about drought (Duffy,
2016).
To date, there is limited scholarship exploring media coverage
of slow-onset hazards. However, a recent review of news coverage
about the California drought found that news stories focused
on slow-onset hazards (such as drought) are generally confined
to episodic frames and focused on socio-economic impacts
(Duffy, 2016). Episodic frames about hazards generally focus
on individual suffering and impacts. Media representations of
hazards that focus on suffering have the potential to arouse
intense emotional responses (Aarøe, 2011). The emotional
emphasis of media coverage of slow-onset hazards has been
criticized for exaggerating risk and sensationalizing serious
concerns, which can create problems for recovery efforts. Despite
concerns about the use of dramatic narrative stories to boost
readership, Solman and Henderson (2019) suggest that disaster
reporting “is one of the few legitimate places for emotional
expression in news journalism” (p. 1642).
Scholars who have examined the use of emotive storytelling
in disaster reporting have suggested that news focused on
others’ suffering may carry more weight than reports focused
on property damage or the severity of the disaster, and are
more effective at capturing media attention and mobilizing
public action (Joye, 2015; Solman and Henderson, 2019).
Indeed, personalized stories about large-scale distant suffering
heightened readers’ emotional distress more than stories focused
on statistical information or stories including photographs of
victims (Maier et al., 2017). Yet previous work in this area has

Personalization, Empathy, Helping, and Drought

Following Batson’s work, empathy is regularly described as
a key factor in social interaction (Gerdes and Segal, 2009),
civic engagement (Miaskiewicz and Monarchi, 2008), and social
tolerance (Segal et al., 2012). Indeed, researchers in the fields of
psychology, social work, and business have identified empathy as
a critical source of prosocial behavior (Grant and Berry, 2011;
Segal et al., 2017; Batson, 2018), often defined as voluntary
actions benefiting others or society (Eisenberg and Miller, 1987).
Bagozzi and Moore (1994) exposed respondents to a “rational”
appeal condition and an emotional appeal (called the highempathy condition) and found that respondents in the latter
group expressed greater intentions to help victims of child
abuse. Participants reported greater distress and willingness to
contribute to an organization that helps children with cancer
when they were exposed to a stimulus with an identified victim
rather than a non-identified victim (Kogut and Ritov, 2005).
Guided by research in the tradition of the theory of reasoned
action (Ajzen, 1991; Kim and Hunter, 1993), Oliver et al. (2012)
found that empathic attitudes were associated with stronger
intentions to help stigmatized groups dealing with healthrelated challenges.
As the examples above illustrate, most of the previous
work considering the role of empathy-arousing messages in
communication has focused on the health domain (e.g., Stiff
et al., 1988; Shen, 2010a,b, 2011). There is also a substantial
body of work in environmental contexts focused on arousing
empathy for animals (Shelton and Rogers, 1981; Schultz, 2000;
Berenguer, 2007, 2010) and assessing the relationships between
empathy, pro-environmental attitudes, and pro-environmental
behavior. For example, Swim and Bloodhart (2015) exposed
participants to messages focused on climate change-related
threats to polar bears, and found that participants prompted
to take the perspective of the animals were more likely (than
those prompted to remain objective) to donate to environmental
advocacy organizations. Here, we expand this work by focusing
on the impacts of drought—though this context has implications
for climate change communication and messages about other
natural hazards and disasters. Drawing on the empathy-altruism
hypothesis and previous work in health and environmental
contexts, we posit the following:

primarily focused on readers’ emotional distress, not readers’
perceptions of others’ suffering. According to (Decety and Lamm,
2006), a prerequisite for communication and empathy arousal is
the preservation of individuality. While making a link between
the self and other though perspective taking is a critically
important component of empathy, separating our own feelings
from others’ feelings and thoughts, or self-other awareness,
is also essential to preventing ecocentric responses to others’
feelings and thoughts (Segal et al., 2017). Therefore, this study
will also examine how personalized news stories impact readers’
perceptions of others’ suffering and whether these perceptions are
associated with state empathy.
H2: Personalized news stories (vs. non-personalized
news stories) will be positively associated with readers’
perceived suffering.
H3: Perceived suffering will be positively associated with
readers’ state empathy.

Narrative Engagement
Narrative engagement, also called absorption, is a popular
umbrella concept used to describe a readers’ immersion into
the story world (Oliver et al., 2012; Appel et al., 2015).
Transportation is a subtype of narrative engagement described
as a psychological state that simultaneously involves attention,
imagery, and emotions (Appel et al., 2015). Transportation
relates to the experience of engaging with, or being transported
into a narrative world (Green et al., 2004). Previous work
has reported mixed results regarding the relationship between
transportation and empathy. Oliver et al. (2012) found that
story involvement, a subtheme in Green and Brock (2000)
narrative transportation scale, influenced emotional reactions to
a narrative news story and intentions to help stigmatized groups
(prisoners and elderly persons). Transportation was a significant
predictor of empathy arousal in response to a narrative but
not a significant mediator of narrative impact on empathy and
cognitive responses (Shen et al., 2014). Drawing on this work, we
propose the following hypotheses:
H4: Personalized news stories (vs. non-personalized
news stories) will be positively associated with readers’
transportation into the story.
H5: Transportation will be positively associated with
perceived suffering and state empathy.

H6. State empathy will be positively associated with intentions
to donate to farmers suffering from drought.

Assessing the Cognitive, Affective, and
Associative Dimensions of Empathy as a
Source of Prosocial Behavior

The Empathy-Altruism Hypothesis
Much of the scholarship on empathy is grounded in the empathyaltruism hypothesis (Batson, 1991). Batson and colleagues
(see Batson et al., 1989, for a review) tested this hypothesis
through a series of experiments exploring the relationship
between empathic feelings (e.g., sympathy, compassion, warmth,
tenderness, etc.), positive attitudes toward others (Batson et al.,
1997b; Finlay and Stephan, 2000), and behavioral intentions
(Batson et al., 2002). Results indicate that participants prompted
to imagine the subject’s feelings (compared to those prompted to
concentrate on being objective) were significantly more likely to
express intentions to donate funds to support an addiction and
counseling service (Batson et al., 2002).

Frontiers in Communication | www.frontiersin.org

Early scholars debated whether empathy-driven prosocial
action occurred in response to others’ affective cues—as
Hoffman (1981) posited—or as a result of a cognitive process
driven by individuals’ perspective taking abilities (Decety and
Jackson, 2006). Proponents of the “affective assumption” have
suggested that narratives generate an emotional involvement
with characters (Slater and Rouner, 2002; Green et al., 2004;
Busselle and Bilandzic, 2009) and that it is the emotional response
to others’ needs that produces the “other-oriented desire” to
reduce perceived distress or suffering (Davis, 1994, p. 134).

Personalization, Empathy, Helping, and Drought

were assigned randomly to one condition (personalized or nonpersonalized). Both conditions included a simulated news story
about drought conditions in the Southwestern U.S. in 2015
(Personalized = 392 words; Non-personalized = 387 words).
Both stories were titled, “Arizona farmers burdened by the
Megadrought” and formatted to resemble an AP-style article. We
included a single image of drought conditions across the state
of California from 2011 to 2015. The image came from the U.S.
Drought Monitor and did not vary across conditions. We kept the
introductory paragraph and the structure of the article the same
across both stories to prevent the introduction of confounding
cues. The articles were based on reports by the Associated Press
and designed to avoid specific partisan cues. Both news stories are
available in the Supplementary Material.
The focus of the articles in the two conditions differed. The
personalized story included three components of personalized
narratives: (1) an identifiable farmer, (2) direct quotes about the
farmer’s experience with drought, and (3) direct quotes about
the farmer’s economic and personal suffering due to drought
conditions. The non-personalized story focused primarily on
expert concern about the 2015 drought. It broadly addressed the
social and economic impacts of drought conditions for farmers in
the Southwest, though it did not include any direct quotes from
individual farmers or descriptions of the character’s emotional
state or experiences.
The survey for this study began with an assessment of
participants’ trait empathy. Trait empathy refers an individual’s
unique ability to respond to another person’s distress while
state empathy is situation based. Following previous scholarship,
we include trait empathy as a control variable likely associated
with state responses to a stimulus (Bagozzi and Moore, 1994;
Finlay and Stephan, 2000; Campbell and Babrow, 2004; Shen,
2010a,b; Shen, 2011; Shen et al., 2014). After completing the
trait measures, participants read one of the two randomly
assigned stories, rated their perceptions of the story, completed
the perceived suffering, state empathy, and transportation
measures, and intentions to donate to farmers affected by
drought in the Southwest. Finally, participants completed
demographic questions.

Indeed, experimental research across a variety of contexts has
found a strong association between readers’ emotional responses
(i.e., distress) and willingness to help victims in need (Kogut and
Ritov, 2005; Maier et al., 2017).
There is also evidence to support the association between
the cognitive dimensions of empathy, including perspective
taking, and prosocial behavior—or the “cognitive hypothesis.”
Perspective taking has been associated with increased
psychological closeness between individuals, helping behavior
(Cialdini et al., 1997), and mimicking behavior (van Baaren et al.,
2009; Müller et al., 2012).
Still, other scholars have suggested that the cognitive and
affective dimensions are “sequentially and causally connected”
(Stiff et al., 1988, p. 200) such that cognition enables people
to take the perspectives of others, but it is affective empathy
that generates the motivation to act. Keen (2010) has suggested
that the affective, cognitive, and associative dimensions are
complementary, especially in response to reading, because
“When texts invite readers to feel, they also stimulate readers’
thinking” (p. 69).
Others have suggested that identification, a key component
of the associative dimension of state empathy, is critical for
communication and behavior because: “you persuade a man [sic]
only insofar as you can talk his language by speech, gesture,
tonality, order, image, attitude, idea, identifying your ways with
his” (Burke, 1969, p. 55). Thus, a character’s identity, gender,
socio-demographic characteristics, along with their expressed
values may generate associative state empathy when they align
with readers’ values and identity. Identification is the process
through which relationships develop and social bonding occurs
(Shen, 2010a,b) and is necessary for message relevance (Campbell
and Babrow, 2004) and reduced reactance, which can lead to the
rejection of persuasive messages (Shen, 2010a). Shen (2010a) has
suggested that identification is associated with Kelman’s theory
of attitude change and may therefore be, “more predictive of
behavior” than the other dimensions of state empathy.
To date, scholarship on empathy in communication regularly
treats the multi-item construct of state empathy as a single
outcome variable, limiting current understanding of the
underlying mechanisms associated with empathy arousal and
helping behavior in response to narrative news stories. Indeed, we
are not familiar with any study to date that has tested a tripartite
model of state empathy, as proposed here. To address this gap,
we use a structural equation model to simultaneously test the
effect of the cognitive, affective, and associative dimensions
of state empathy on prosocial behavior, asking the following
research question:

Participants
Eleven participants dropped out of the study before they
could complete the survey and were removed from the data,
resulting in a sample size of N = 249. Participants were
undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory course on
mass communication at a public university in the midwestern
United States (M age = 20 years, SD = 1.4 years). We distributed
surveys in a classroom setting and provided participants extra
credit for participation. Most respondents were women (67%)
who had completed some college (M = 2.73 and SD = 0.68) and
self-reported as moderately wealthy growing up (1 = poor to 5
= wealthy; M = 3.2, SD = 0.90), with income in the range of
$50,000 to $99,000 (1 = less than $10,000 to 9 = over $150,000;
M = 6.35, SD = 2.13). While we didn’t ask for information
about race, the student population at this University is 70% white
(Data USA, n.d.).

RQ1: To what extent do the cognitive, affective, and
associative dimensions of state empathy influence intentions
to donate to others?

METHODS
Stimuli
Data were collected using online surveys through the Qualtrics
platform. The survey took 15 min to complete. Participants

In our sample, 62 participants had a single missing value,
resulting in a small portion (0.44%) of the total number of
missing values over the total number of responses across all
participants. Preliminary tests were conducted in SPSS 26 (IBM).
For all analysis p < 0.05 was considered significant. Scale
reliability was measured using Cronbach’s alpha >0.65 was
considered acceptable (Nunnally, 1978).2

Transportation into the story was assessed using Appel
et al.’s (2015) Transportation Scale – Short Form. The fiveitem items had seven-point response scales (from 1 = not at
all) to 7 = very much) and were reliable (M = 4.07, SD =

Intentions to donate were measured after reading the
newspaper articles. Participants read the following statement:
“Lots of things come up that keep people from donating to social
organizations even if they want to.” Respondents then answered
the question: “Would you be willing to donate money to help
farmers in the Southwest affected by the drought?” by selecting
one of two possible options: 0 = no, 1 = yes.
Trait empathy was measured using the affective and cognitive
dimensions of the Social Empathy Index (SEI) (Gerdes et al.,
2011; Segal et al., 2012). The full SEI includes 22 items measuring
five dimensions of empathy and responses range from 1 = never
to 6 = always. The scale included 9 items measuring the affective
dimensions of trait empathy (M = 4.53, SD = 0.67, Chronbach’s
alpha = 0.83). Example questions included: “When I see someone
receive a gift that makes them happy, I feel happy myself,” “I am
good at understanding other people’s emotions.” And “When I
see someone being publicly embarrassed, I cringe a little.” One
item was removed to improve scale reliability (“When I see
someone accidentally hit his or her thumb with a hammer, I feel
a flash of pain myself ”).

Measurements
State empathy was measured using a previously validated scale
(Shen, 2011). The scale included 12 items representing the
affective, cognitive, and associative dimensions of state empathy
and ranged from 1 = not at all to 5 = completely. Principal-axis
factoring with varimax rotation identified a three-factor solution
explaining 64% of the variance in state empathy (Factor scores
and items listed in Table 1). The first factor labeled “cognitive”
was associated with five statements pertaining to the reader’s
understanding of others’ point of view and recognition of the
situation detailed in the articles (M = 3.61, SD = 0.70, Cronbach’s
alpha = 0.84). The second factor, which we labeled “affective”
was associated with four statements related to readers’ emotional
reactions to the story (M = 3.07, SD = 0.94, Cronbach’s alpha
= 0.89). The final factor we labeled “associative,” and it was
comprised of three statements about identifying with the topic
and individual experiences detailed in the stories (M = 2.97, SD
= 1.02, Cronbach’s alpha = 0.88). In the following sections, we
refer to these as cognitive SE, affective SE, and associative SE.
Perceived suffering was measured using three items asking
participants to indicate whether the story portrayed the pain,
suffering and distress associated with drought in the Southwest
(from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree). The three items
created a reliable scale and were collapsed (M = 3.51, SD = 0.87,
Cronbach’s alpha = 0.89).

Analysis
The theoretical model was tested in Mplus 8 using structural
equation modeling (SEM) in Muthén and Muthén (1998-2017).
We used the WLSMV estimator, recommended for models with
categorical outcome variables. The chi-square value reported
below is calculated using the DIFFTEST function in Mplus. Trait
empathy was placed in the model as a control on state empathy.
Story personalization (0 = non-personalized; 1 = personalized)
was an exogenous variable that influenced all of the other posttest variables in the model: perceived suffering, state empathy and
prosocial intentions.

Model Results
Based on the aforementioned results, the hypothesized model
was reduced to Figure 1 without associative SE and no direct
association between story format and transportation. The final
model fit the data well: χ2 (4) = 29.0, p < 0.000, RMSEA
(Root Mean Square Error of Approximation) = 0.035, CFI
(Comparative Fit Index) = 0.93, and explained 87% of the
variance in intention to donate (see Figure 2).
Story personalization was significantly associated with
cognitive SE (β = 0.17, SE = 0.06, p < 0.01) and affective SE
(β = 0.15, SE = 0.07, p < 0.05) (H1). Story personalization was
also significantly associated with perceived suffering (β = 0.17,
SE = 0.06, p < 0.01) (H2). The intensity of perceived suffering
was positively associated with both the cognitive (β = 0.37, SE =
0.09, p < 0.001) and affective dimensions of state empathy (β =
0.24, SE = 0.08, p < 0.01), providing support for H3.
Transportation was positively and significantly associated
with perceived suffering (β = 0.56, SE = 0.06, p < 0.000),
cognitive SE (β = 0.35, SE = 0.08, p < 0.000), and affective SE
(β = 0.61, SE = 0.06, p < 0.000), providing support for H5.
H6 was supported. There was a significant association
between affective SE and intentions to donate (β = 0.39, SE
= 0.16, p < 0.05). Cognitive SE, perceived suffering, and
transportation were not directly associated with intentions to
donate. This finding highlights the potential importance of
affective responses to narrative stories as a critical pathway to
promote prosocial intentions and provides limited support for
the “cognitive hypothesis.”
We used 1,000 bootstrap samples and bias-corrected
confidence intervals to explore the specific indirect effects of
transportation and perceived suffering on behavioral intentions.
The specific indirect effects of transportation on donations,
through affective SE, are significant (β = 0.222, SE = 0.10, p =
0.025) 95% CI [0.075, 0.375].

Model fit was evaluated using the comparative fit index (CFI),
standardized root-mean-square residual (SRMR), and rootmean-square error of approximation (RMSEA) criteria identified
by Hu and Bentler (1999): CFI > 0.90 and RMSEA < 0.05. We
adopted a 95% confidence model in the bootstrapping procedure.
All exogenous variables were correlated.

RESULTS
Because this research concerned both the impact of story type on
behavioral intentions and the mediating role of state empathy,
perceived suffering, and transportation, we followed O’Keefe’s
(2003) suggestion and did not conduct a message manipulation
check as the messages differed on objective, modifiable features.
We used a structural equation model to evaluate the direct and
indirect effects of personification on state empathy, perceived
suffering, transportation, and intentions to donate.

Preliminary Analysis
Correlations between key variables are presented in Table 2.
To address H1, H2, and H4, we conducted ANOVA tests to
evaluate the main effects of personalization on state empathy
(SE), perceived suffering, and transportation. Descriptive results
are reported in Table 3. There were significant treatment group
effects on cognitive SE F (1, 246) = 11.73, p < 0.001 and affective
SE F (1, 246) = 8.54, p < 0.01. Respondents’ scores on perceived
suffering also varied significantly between the personalized and
non-personalized story versions F (1, 247) = 6.72, p < 0.01.
These findings provide support for H1 (i.e., personalization is
associated with state empathy) and H2 (i.e., personalization is

Relative to participants exposed to the non-personalized

on proposed patterns of causality between empathy-arousing
messages and prosocial intentions and advances the use of
empathy-arousing messages and emotional storytelling in the
context of drought and natural hazards. This study’s findings
also illustrate the nuanced effects of state empathy on behavioral
intentions and the importance of affective responses to narratives
portraying human suffering. Overall, the expected relationships

can take (Zhou and Niederdeppe, 2017). Future work could
also explore how narrative dramatization, emotionalization, and
fictionalization might influence readers’ emotional and prosocial
responses to news coverage about natural hazards.
In this study, only affective state empathy was directly
associated with intentions to donate. This finding reinforces
previous evidence suggesting that affective empathy is more
proximal to action than the cognitive dimension (Singer and
Lamm, 2009). Moreover, these results suggest that the connection
between empathy and prosocial intentions may only occur with
the arousal of the affective dimension of empathy, providing one
potential explanation for the previously mixed results exploring
the empathy-arousing ability of narratives (Keen, 2007). These
results suggest that the current empathy-altruism hypothesis
could be modified to better account for differences in the effect
of the cognitive, affective, and associative dimensions of state
empathy on behavioral intentions.

suggested that identification (associative SE) is a key dimension
of state empathy, we were not able to verify these findings because
our stimuli did not generate a significant associative response. It
is possible that this is due to the nature of the sample and a story
focused on an adult farmer instead of a younger subject.
Perceived suffering was directly associated with the affective
and cognitive dimensions of state empathy. While previous work
has used perceived suffering as a criterion for the selection of
empathy-arousing messages (Shen, 2011), this study empirically
tested the role of perceived suffering in activating state empathy
and prosocial intentions. Our findings highlight the importance
of perceived suffering in state empathy arousal, but fail to
provide evidence of a significant effect of perceived suffering on
prosocial behaviors. While Maier et al. (2017) found that news
stories about large-scale distant suffering were more effective in
generating emotional responses (e.g., sympathy, sadness, anger),
and indirectly, charitable giving, we only found partial support
for these associations in the context of drought. It is possible
that perceived suffering is not as strongly associated with helping
behavior as actual emotional distress or transportation. Indeed,
the observed significant indirect effects from transportation to
intentions through affective SE would appear to support this
assertion. It is also possible that the use of younger participants,
less able to regulate emotions (Somerville et al., 2010), also
contributed to these results. We discuss the limitations of using
a student sample in detail below. These findings may also be due
to the fact that this study emphasized the economic impacts of
drought on farmers. Previous scholarship in agro-environmental
contexts has found that economic messages have a more muted
effect on public opinions than environmental messages (Peterson
et al., 2019). Future work could explore alternative frames with
varying degrees of emotional arousal.
Oliver et al. (2012) found differences in one of the
two transportation measures (differences in story involvement
but no differences in story impact) between the narrative
and non-narrative story formats. In this study, we found a
strong association between narrative engagement and perceived
suffering and narrative engagement and state empathy. These
results appear to confirm Oliver et al.’s (2012) assertation
that narrative engagement precedes compassionate and affective
responses to narrative stories.
Previous research has revealed inconsistent effects of story
manipulation on transportation when readers were assigned
specific reading goals (e.g., proofreading vs. regular reading) or
when stories were labeled as fact or fiction (Gnambs et al., 2014).
Shen et al. (2014) also reported mixed results with transportation:
narrative stories with an environmental frame led to greater
transportation, but stories with an economic frame revealed no
increase in audience transportation. Our results indicating no
direct effect between personalization and transportation align
with these previous findings. Similarly, the personified story used
in this study focused on farmers’ economic losses. Given these
results, it is possible that economic frames are less effective
in generating transportation and future work should explore
this option. While our study revealed no significant differences
in transportation between a personalized and non-personalized
story, personalization is only one form that strategic narratives

Limitations
Participants were limited to students at a public university in the
U.S. It is possible that participants with more direct experience
with drought or farming would be more likely to identify with the
individual profiled in the personalized news story. It is possible
that lack of experience with drought contributed to the lack of an
observed direct relationship between identification and prosocial
behavior. In addition, students’ limited ability to make a financial
contribution might be another reason for the lack of direct effects
of story type or perceived suffering on prosocial behavior. Finally,
participants were recruited as part of a class on media and society.
Thus, this population may be more sensitized to different modes
of communication and thus less affected by the stimuli used in
this study. We recommend that future research replicate this
study with adults.
Additionally, our measure of readers’ donations, which we
used to test Hypothesis 6 and Research Question 1, assessed
participants’ general intention to donate money, rather than
asking them to make an actual donation or to specify how much
they would donate. Although research related to the Theory
of Planned Behavior (Ajzen, 1991) suggests that individuals’
behavioral intentions are often highly correlated with their actual
behavior, assessing actual donations would have been preferable.
Additionally, the yes/no format of the donation intentions
question may have obscured differences between participants in
the degree to which they planned to donate, or made them more
likely to select the “yes” option (given it did not have a monetary
value attached to it). Future research that enables participants to
make actual donations of differing amounts would be a valuable
next step.
Finally, the approach used in this study tells only how
respondents felt immediately after reading personalized and nonpersonalized articles about drought. This approach provides us
with limited information about the potential cumulative effect of
mass media disaster coverage or the long-term impacts of reading
a personalized news story about large-scale distant disasters.
In spite of these limitations, these findings suggest that
personalized news stories about drought events are one potential
pathway to encourage readers’ emotional responses, including

Personalization, Empathy, Helping, and Drought

to support individuals suffering due to drought. In addition,
our findings suggest that personalized stories designed to
produce prosocial intentions may be more effective when they
generate a combination of transportation, perceived suffering,
and affective state empathy. In sum, these results point to ways
that environmental writers and reporters can raise awareness
and potentially mobilize social action around drought and
water scarcity.

perceived suffering and state empathy. Our results also suggest
that transportation into a story, perceived suffering and state
empathy may interact in important ways to contribute to
intentions to support individuals during drought events. While
intentions are important, social action around drought, water
scarcity, and climate change will require significantly more
direct action, including political lobbying, organizing, and public
protests. While we found many important relationships between
our primary measures, we found no direct relationship between
personalization and behavioral intentions. Thus, additional work
is needed to further explore the effect of emotional storytelling
on the adoption of prosocial actions in response to drought and
natural hazards.
In addition, we add a note of caution about the use of
personalized stories to motivate action. Prior evidence from
a variety of studies in health communication suggests that
personalized stories are effective in encouraging individual
attitudes and behaviors. However, previous research has also
highlighted the limitations of using personalized narratives to
generate collective action or promote specific social policies.
For example, compared to depersonalized formats, personalized
narratives generated more counterarguments in response to
claims that social factors drive obesity (Zhou and Niederdeppe,
2017) and less support for school-based nutrition policies (Barry
et al., 2013). Moreover, given the potential for psychological
reactance to messages about climate change (Dixon et al., 2019;
Ma et al., 2019), messages about drought must be carefully
designed and tested to avoid responses that might undermine
effective persuasion (Nabi et al., 2018). Future scholarship
should explore the potential for personalized narratives in
environmental contexts to encourage both individual-level
attitudes and behaviors as well as collective action and
policy support.
Given the potential for the frequency, duration, and severity
of drought events to increase, there is a critical need for further
study about the use of emotional storytelling for hazard coverage.
Our work focused on personalized and non-personalized news
stories about farmers, but future work could explore empathic
and prosocial responses to stories about other groups (i.e.,
the elderly, immigrants). Previous research has suggested that
reports about floods by Western-dominated global media are
less likely to use personal stories about individual suffering
when reporting about flooding in the developing world (Solman
and Henderson, 2019). Future work could explore if readers’
empathic responses to stories about individual suffering vary by
subject location, nationality, gender, and race.
The extreme suffering produced by drought highlights the
importance of understanding how to mobilize an effective
collective response to slow-onset hazards such as drought and
water scarcity. One potential tool for such mobilization is
the media. Yet while “just-the-facts” reporting about drought,
environmental hazards, or climate change, may raise awareness
about these environmental issues, emotive storytelling and
personalized narratives appear to be a promising tool to
generate readers’ empathic responses and, indirectly, intentions
